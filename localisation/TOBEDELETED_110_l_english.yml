His advisor kept silent, he didn't know what to say to the Caliph. Of course, the city would be badly damaged by the planned siege, he thought that was most obvious, but decided not to pester the Caliph about what may happen to the city he is daydreaming about. 'Do you understand, my friend? This city is the capital of the oldest existing empire! If we succeed, the entire world, and maybe even Allah himself, will sing our names for centuries to come! This wi-', the advisor interrupted him 'Yes, your Majesty, I understand. But you must decide what to do with the city afterward. Its walls won't hold for long and the army WILL want payment after such a long siege'. 'Are you suggesting that I sack the 'City of the World's Desire'?!'  -  the Caliph was angered by such a suggestion  -  'There are hundreds, if not thousands even, years of history and knowledge kept in those walls, the Theodosian Walls, might I say. No, I will not sack it! The World will think of us as savages if we dare do such a thing!', he stopped for a bit to think. 'Listen to me, Your Ma-', this time the advisor was cut off  -  'Enough! Go to your tent, Shura. I will see you with the other advisors at dawn.'. 'Very well...', answered the advisor, who didn't want to anger him further, 'Good night, sir.'  -  the Caliph did not respond, he was looking out into the bay, into the Golden Horn - the chain that was blocking his navy from blockading the city efficiently, he pondered on what to do about it. It seemed like the words of the advisor about army payment had fallen on deaf ears."

Emperor, my bad, and his son was there, with golden armour and red cloaks, with bright shields that would reflect the sunlight!', the children were very captivated by the thought of warriors in golden armour, the old man then continued 'They got cut down, the dumb bastards, dead right then and there.' The children were suprised, how could these golden warriors fall just like that? The old man continued his story for another good 40 minutes then finished by saying this: 'Now, if you don't believe me then, just go to the main square and you'll see! A statue of marble, gold and silver! Go on then! See it for yourselves!', he smiled as the children got up and left for the main square."

'Yes, it's seems to be fair to both parties.' says one diplomat. 'No! It's unfair.' says the other. We have had enough of this!
