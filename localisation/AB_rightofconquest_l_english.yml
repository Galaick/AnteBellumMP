 ab_bulgaria.4.d: "Dating back to the days of Kubrat Khan and the founding of Old Great Bulgaria, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is never without a Kavkhan as his right hand. From the old illustrious families of the Kavkhan Kin, to dynamic appointees of their own merit, our Kavkhan have always been the foremost advisors of our great ruler; even co-rulers when necessary. Yet, with historical duties ranging from judge, to diplomat, to commander-in-chief of our army, we need to choose the focus of the Kavkhan’s role for [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s reign."

# Events #
 ab_abbasid.1.t: "The Abbasid Restoration"
 ab_abbasid.1.d: "Baghdad's desecration by the barbarous Mongol horde in the 13th Century effectively marked an end to Abbasid rule as an independent entity, scarring the pride of the one true Caliphate. Forced into exile within the fledgling Nizzarid Sultanate in Egypt, the role of the Caliph was reduced to a mere mockery of its former self. Little more than a ceremonial figurehead, whose job was to sign off on documents from the Nizzarid Sultan's court, the Abbasid Caliphs have been little more than prisoners in their own home within Cairo for far too long. With the fall of the Nizzarid Dynasty, Egypt's military leadership have elected to break the gilded cage, restoring them to their former authority. With the legitimate sovereigns enthroned once again, perhaps even greater heights can be reached than before."
 ab_abbasid.1.a: "Let the enemies of Islam quake!"

 ab_abbasid.2.t: "Extinction of the Nizzarids"
 ab_abbasid.2.d: "With the Nizzarid Dynasty's collapse comes a new era for the Egyptian Sultanate but, without the stratocracy's guiding hand, the future remains uncertain. Among the most pressing issues is, to be expected, one of utmost urgency if national stability is to be preserved; the new dynasty which shall take the reigns. Without a designated successor, it falls to the military leadership to select the new ruler, as they had done with Nizzar the Great well over a century ago. Following a process of elimination, they have arrived at a handful of respectable options:"
 ab_abbasid.2.a: "Get the generals to draw straws from a bale"
 ab_abbasid.2.b: "We must look back to the Caliphate of old!"

 nizzarid_event.1.t: "Military Coup"
 nizzarid_event.1.d: "Decadence in our armies, combined with military incompetence of our ruler led to a coup staged by our generals. They seek to overthrow Nizzarid dynasty and install a new ruler by the right of conquest."
 nizzarid_event.1.a: "We will crush them!"

 nizzarid_event.2.t: "End of Military Coup"
 nizzarid_event.2.d: "The disastrous civil war that ravaged our country is finally over."
 nizzarid_event.2.a: "Time to lick our wounds..."

 nizzarid_event.6.t: "Plague in Alexandria"
 nizzarid_event.6.d: "A city as important and well connected as Alexandria will always be vulnerable to epidemics and has seen many of them come and go through the centuries. The plague outbreak of $YEAR$ is, however, something quite out of the ordinary. The disease has struck our city very hard and some say a third of the population is now dead or dying. The ruling dynasty and the nobles have already left the city."
 nizzarid_event.6.a: "Dreadful..."

 nizzarid_event.7.t: "Flooding of the Nile"
 nizzarid_event.7.d: "Following many days of heavy rains, the flow rate of water exceeded the capacity of river channel and it broke out of its usual boundaries. Entire region of Nile's delta is flooded and the damage is incalculable."
 nizzarid_event.7.a: "Tragedy"

 nizzarid_event.8.t: "Military Reform of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]"
 nizzarid_event.8.d: "The Nizzarid armies were traditionally formed mainly by the cavalry units. This cavalry tradition was established by the founder of our country, Nizzar the Great, who then passed it onto his generals and his son, ensuring that the our Cataphracts would wreak havoc on the battlefield. In the recent years, we have deflected from that tradition and neglected the importance of once the mightiest and most elite units of our army. Because of that, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] passed a new reform in which he wishes to return the core of our army back to it's glorious roots."
 nizzarid_event.8.a: "Excellent"

 nizzarid_event.10.t: "Syrian Revolt of [GetYear]"
 nizzarid_event.10.d: "The treacherous governor of our province of Syria has gained a support of local tribes and lesser nobility and now rose in a revolt against our rule, seeking to establish independent Syrian state."
 nizzarid_event.10.a: "Crush them!"

 nizzarid_event.11.t: "Army Officers Joining Enemy"
 nizzarid_event.11.d: "Many of our army officers have decided to support the coup and are now fighting besides our enemies."
 nizzarid_event.11.a: "To hell with them!"

 nizzarid_event.12.t: "Soldiers Deserting"
 nizzarid_event.12.d: "Because of the low morale in our armies, many of our soldiers are deserting or even worse, joining the enemies of the Sultan."
 nizzarid_event.12.a: "They will all be hanged!"

 nizzarid_event.13.t: "Bedouins Joining our Cause"
 nizzarid_event.13.d: "The Bedouin tribes living in the border regions of our realm have arrived to reaffirm their loyalty and have joined us in battle."
 nizzarid_event.13.a: "Excellent!"

 nizzarid_event.14.t: "Civilian Unrest"
 nizzarid_event.14.d: "As our men are fighting the enemies of the Sultan, the cities are left without a proper garrison which would be able to prevent local unrest. Due to that, the peasants are now roaming the streets of our towns, causing unrest and even calling for an open rebellion. We must do something!"
 nizzarid_event.14.a: "Refill the garrison and stop them!"
 nizzarid_event.14.b: "We need our men elsewhere..."

 nizzarid_event.15.t: "Advisors are leaving the Court"
 nizzarid_event.15.d: "Because of the difficult situation we are currently facing, many advisors and scholars decided to leave the country and search for employment abroad."
 nizzarid_event.15.a: "We can't stop them"

 nizzarid_event.16.t: "Fall of Jerusalem"
 nizzarid_event.16.d: "At long last, the wretched infidels stand defeated, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] has avenged the humiliating defeat suffered by his ancestors. After a long and bloody siege, the walls of Jerusalem were breached by our forces, and the infidels' king was captured. Not stripped of any gold or finery, he was quietly beheaded outside the city gates; this was the noble death that the Christians did not reserve for the disgraced Sultan Al-Husayn, who was forced to accept the humiliating peace treaty, and made to return to Alexandria a broken shell of a man. Now, the weak and elderly Al-Husayn stands atop the city wall with our Sultan, [Root.Monarch.GetName], as they look out into the desert at the setting sun. The banner of the House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] is draped over the Dome of Rock's front entrance and cataphract heavy cavalry conclude their victory march about the city's streets. This victory marks the dawn of a new age, not just for the [Root.GetName], but for the whole of Dar al-Islam."
 nizzarid_event.16.a: "Allahu Akbar!"

 nizzarid_event.17.t: "The Ark of the Covenant"
 nizzarid_event.17.d: "During our military incursion into the lands of Al-Habash, our soldiers have stumbled upon a relic hidden in the temple of [1227.GetName]. The relic is believed to be the Ark of the Covenant, created by the prophet Musa ibn Imran, based on the pattern revealed to him by the almighty Allah. Given the religious significance of the relic, we should ensure that the object is kept in a safe place. Moving it to [Root.Capital.GetName] would surely strengthen our legitimacy as the rightful leaders of Dar al-Islam, however, such action would also enrage the Christian population living within the borders of our Sultanate and beyond."
 nizzarid_event.17.a: "The Ark will be transported to [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 nizzarid_event.17.b: "The Ark will stay in [1227.GetName]"
 
 nizzarid_event.18.t: "The Arabization of the Turks"
 nizzarid_event.18.d: "The Turkish inhabitants of Anatolia are perplexingly contradictory. They are at once Muslim, Christian, and Zoroastrian. They straddle the line between the steppe and cities, claiming connections to both Chinggis Khan and Muhammad. The time has come to assist them in making up their mind. With our control over Anatolia cemented, it is high time that we allow the Turks to speak the language of the prophet so that they may more appropriately join us in prayer. Surely they will benefit from the standardization of their writing system as well, in the traditional arabic lettering of course."
 nizzarid_event.18.a: "This will only strengthen Dar al-Islam"

 nizzarid_event.19.t: "The Academy of Nizzar the Great"
 nizzarid_event.19.d: "The Greek King of Nicaea opened a military academy for the training of his troops shortly after his state declared independence from the Empire of the Romans. The ruling house of Gabras now claims that their troops are the true successors of Iskandar and his phalanx, that their discipline is equivalent to those of the legendary warriors that conquered their way from Macedon to India. This is laughable. Our Sultan has decided to establish his very own military academy in Iskandariyya to cement the supremacy of our troops in professionalism, arms, and tactics. No army shall stand against the [Root.GetName]!"
 nizzarid_event.19.a: "The legacy of the Invictus lives on!"

 nizzarid_event.20.t: "The Nizzarid Caliphate"
 nizzarid_event.20.d: "The title of Caliph is one that requires its holder to be viewed by the entire Islamic world as legitimate. The current Caliph is our puppet from the House of Abbas, who has become an increasing nusiance through the deacdes. For centuries, the Caliph was content to hold only ceremonial power over us, and allowed the Sultan to administer his realm as the true sovereign, but more recent puppet-Caliphs have become proggressively more bold, attempting to undermine the Sultan and drum up support among legitimists so that they might restore the House of Abbas' power and depose us. For this reason, the Sultan has decided to dismiss the Caliph. Permanently. He will be sent to an estate in Baghdad where he can retire peacefully after being ritualistically stripped of his title, which will be relinquished to [Root.Monarch.GetName], who will reign as the first Caliph of the House of Nizzar, establishing our de jure right to rule and conquer."
 nizzarid_event.20.a: "We are the sword of the Prophet!"

 nizzarid_event.21.t: "Restoration of the House of Wisdom"
 nizzarid_event.21.d: "The House of Wisdom at Baghdad was once known to host the greatest assemblies of scholars and wise-men anywhere in the Islamic world. After centuries of squabbling between rival regional dynasties, the House, and more broadly all of Baghdad, has become unrecognizably decrepit and deserted. Despite the folly of past administrations, our Sultan, dedicated in his pursuit of knowledge as any Islamic leader should be, has financed a massive undertaking to restore the House of Wisdom in an aesthetic and scholastic capacity; employing the greatest artisans to reconstruct its facade and interior, and importing scripture, research, and literature from accross the world to restock the shelves at the House's library. The new official name of the building-complex will now be the Imperial Academy of Art, Literature, and Science."
 nizzarid_event.21.a: "Very well"

 naz_sword_islam_title: "Sword of Islam"
 naz_sword_islam_desc: "Since our humiliating defeat at Sidon, where the sultan Al-Husayn was brutally cut down by the treacherous infidel, we have been plotting our revenge. The crusader kings think themselves to be the shield of christianity. Let us martial the largest army in our Sultanate's history and prove once and for all that no shield may parry the sword of Islam!"
 naz_liberate_jerusalem_title: "Liberate Al-Quds"
 naz_liberate_jerusalem_desc: "The primary goal of our war against the christians is to recapture the holy city of Jerusalem from which muslim pilgrims have been turned away for too long. We cannot delay our attack further, knowing the desecration that the holy monuments of the city have no doubt faced under the rule of the crusader scum."
 naz_purge_crusaders_title: "Purge the Crusaders"
 naz_purge_crusaders_desc: "The crusading nobility of the holy land must be rooted out from every castle they have built and every location which they have turned into one their blasphemous principalities. The settlers they brought with them are a different story. We could allow them to continue their worship in peace, knowing that they will not disturb our state, or send missionaries to supplicate them to Allah's light with a little...force."
 naz_seize_antioch_title: "Seize Antioch"
 naz_seize_antioch_desc: "Antioch and Alexandretta are two of the world's most well-fortified cities. The citadel the crusaders have built at Antioch is undeniably impressive, but its walls will fall if their prince dares come to the aid of his cousins in Jerusalem when we attempt to retake the holy city once more."
 naz_conquer_cyprus_title: "Conquer Cyprus"
 naz_conquer_cyprus_desc: "The crusader isle of Cyprus will prove difficult to occupy. The fortified island is notoriously difficult to invade; perhaps if we blockade the surrounding waters for long enough, we can stage a quick siege that will break their spirit enough for them to surrender."
 naz_bastion_christianity_title: "Bastion of the Knights"
 naz_bastion_christianity_desc: "We have wrought destruction upon the crusaders and uprooted them from the Levant, but our merchants continue to complain of the harassment they face by the last Catholic holdouts in the Aegean. The Knights of Rhodes are a naval nuisance that will be destroyed, just as their so-called 'brothers of the sword' were."
 naz_cilicia_title: "Dismantle Cilicia"
 naz_cilicia_desc: "The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia is a thorn in our side. Having been allowed to fester like a wound for far too long, the kingdom has become bold, aligning itself with other christian powers in the region. We cannot allow this foreign occupation of Tarsus to perpetuate any longer. We would sooner the damned Greeks rule over that land than its current overlords! Of course, we will be the ones ruling it soon enough."
 naz_follow_nile_title: "Follow the Nile"
 naz_follow_nile_desc: "The various kingdoms of Nubia seem to believe that we are unaware of their existence. They squabble amongst themselves as if we are not capable of destroying the whole of them in a single war. Now that we have the might, we should have a force martialed in upper Egypt to cross into Nubia and seize their lands - rich in ebony, ivory, and gold."
 naz_oases_title: "Settle the Oases"
 naz_oases_desc: "Deep in the Egyptian desert, there are several oases, some already partially settled with tribal towns. They could be prime locations to develop to house our growing population. [Root.Capital.GetName] should only have so many residents, after all."
 naz_integrate_copts_title: "Integrate the Copts"
 naz_integrate_copts_desc: "The Miaphysite Christians of Abyssinia are nothing like the crusaders. Many of them are amiable to our sultan, and they have made excellent advisors in the martial and administrative fields. It is not within our interest to suppress their culture, but rather to accept them as they are. Their well-disciplined Cawa warriors will be made officers in our army, as they fare better on the battlefield than many of our own native force."
 naz_nubia_title: "Dominate Nubia"
 naz_nubia_desc: "The remainder of Nubia continues to elude us despite our conquest of the interior. In order to assert our control over the Red Sea and inland trade routes, we must secure Nubia in its entirety."
 naz_ethiopia_title: "Control Al-Habash"
 naz_ethiopia_desc: "Having subjugated the Nubians to our rule, we are face to face with the highly-mythicized kingdom of Abyssinia, or Ethiopia, as its own inhabitants call it. The emperor of this state claims to be the last bastion of christianity in Africa, and to be in possession of the Ark of the Covenant. The unstoppable tide of Islam cannot be allowed to cease in the face of such arrogance. Ethiopia and all its riches shall be ours!"
 naz_turkish_tradition_title: "Turco-Arab Traditions"
 naz_turkish_tradition_desc: "Among the Turks, those already converted to Islam are remarkably pious, though they know not the language of the prophet, nor the traditional islamic methods of administration. Under our rule, the same pashas will manage the Anatolian provinces as under the Seljuks, but they shall now write and speak in terms we can understand. This could be the beginning of a beautiful blending of cultures not dissimilar to the adoption of Arabic traditions by our Egyptian ancestors so long ago."
 naz_extinguish_title: "Extinguish the Flames"
 naz_extinguish_desc: "Persia remains an enigma. Despite centuries of incursion, no Muslim state has ever managed a campaign into the heart of Iran and remained intact long enough to integrate the region into Dar al-Islam. To answer the call of the Great Allah, we shall embark upon a journey of conquest that will mirror that of Iskandar himself, sweeping into Persia with a force never before seen!"
 naz_iran_title: "Rule Iran"
 naz_iran_desc: "What is Iran now, but a plateau populated by the same arrogant heathens that Iskandar himself once subjugated in the Hellenic age? It is the destiny of the House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] to put the entire region kneel before the crescent, and prove once and for all that the unrelenting tide of Islam is truly unstoppable."
 naz_khorasan_title: "Secure Khorasan"
 naz_khorasan_desc: "The natural extension of our conquest in Iran is the subjugation of Khorasan, whose multiethnic polities are divided between nomadic and settled people, all of whom will make easy targets for our forces as we secure the logical borders of our empire."
 naz_anatolian_title: "Anatolian Hegemony"
 naz_anatolian_desc: "With the Seljuks defeated, it follows that we should take advantage of the Anatolian power vacuum by bringing the various remaining Turkish states into the fold, along with the Greek kingdom of Nicaea, the last holdout of Hellenic civilization on the peninsula."
 naz_constantinople_title: "Sack Qustantiniyah"
 naz_constantinople_desc: "Qustantiniyah, known as the City of the World's Desire, is not necessarily reflective of its epithet anymore. Although it has been eclipsed in grandeur by various cities throughout the world, the Bosphorus Strait remains a critical chokepoint for our naval and trading operations in the mediterranean. Surely the Osmanoglu trading family will appreciate a more theologically sympathetic overlord."
 naz_georgia_title: "Devastate Georgia"
 naz_georgia_desc: "The Christian Kingdom of Georgia is not necessarily a threat, but securing the strategic Caucasus mountain range within our borders could prove to be an advantageous defense against the hordes beyond the peaks."
 naz_sassanids_title: "End the Sassanid Legacy"
 naz_sassanids_desc: "The Sassanids, similarly to the Romans, boast that they are the last bastion of an empire that, in some shape or form, has lasted two thousand years. The time has come to show these arrogant fools that no flame can protect them. The Shahanshah should know by now that his ancient cataphract tactics are showing their age."
 naz_fareast_title: "Foothold in the Far East"
 naz_fareast_desc: "The further reaches of the Indian Ocean are home to the mysterious spice islands. From these rich and densely jungled lands flow some of the most desired spices and materials in the world. With just one city in the region in our control, we can funnel riches untold into our homeland!"
 naz_malacca_trade_title: "Control the Melaka Strait"
 naz_malacca_trade_desc: "We are within a hair's breadth of total east-west trade hegemony, in both the indian ocean and over the silk road. If we can just maintain a hold over the strait of Melaka, the gateway to China, no other power will dare contest our merchants."
 naz_sicily_title: "Invade Sicily"
 naz_sicily_desc: "Having stemmed from the Tunisians, the Sicilian sultanate is a piratical threat that we anticipated. This, however, doesn't mean that their actions are acceptable. Just like their unruly cousin to the south, the heretical Sicilian Sultan shall face retribution for his constant incursions into our waters."
 naz_andalusia_title: "Fall of Al-Andalus"
 naz_andalusia_desc: "The Maghreb is now fully under the control of our state, and across the pillars of Hercules, the Andalusian garrison at Jabal-Tariq practically taunts us! With friction building up at the gate of the Mediterranean, the so-called Caliph in Cordoba must know what comes next. We shall launch an all-out assault, defeating our rival once and for all, dethroning the illegitimate Caliph and uniting Dar al-Islam under one banner!"
 naz_dockyard_title: "Imperial Dockyards"
 naz_dockyard_desc: "From Venetian smugglers and zealous naval Knights to Barbary Pirates and every maritime threat in between, our Mediterranean waters face constant threat. To protect our coastline, we must construct a grand fleet, and to do so, we must create a grand dockyard in the capital. From there, we will launch a thousand ships and more so that we are no longer navally challenged."
 naz_reform_cavalry_title: "Nizzarid Cataphracts"
 naz_reform_cavalry_desc: "The shock cavalry that Nizzar utilized to dethrone the Ayyubids centuries ago remains the core of our armies. These noble cataphracts are drafted from the highest strata of our society and their discipline and valor is unmatched by any European knight. To ensure that the prevalence of firearms on modern battlefields does not render our cavalry irrelevant, we must reform the units and train them in the usage of firearms, as well as in new tactics that will allow them to disrupt and disarm modern infantry formations."
 naz_empower_stratocracy_title: "Empower the Stratocracy"
 naz_empower_stratocracy_desc: "The most senior administrators of our state are the Sultan's loyal generals, among whose ranks are the most seasoned and innovative military men in Dar al-Islam, nay, the world. Without their leadership, our Sultan must admit, he would be nobody at all. To ensure their future loyalty, we will promote them to official governmental positions beyond the military, altering our state so that it may better serve our army, rather than vice versa."
 naz_legacy_invictus_title: "Legacy of the Invictus"
 naz_legacy_invictus_desc: "Nizzar the Great was known for the unmatched discipline of his fighters. It is said that he personally trained his men, performing strength training and combat drills alongside them, not unlike his greatest inspiration, al-Iskandar al-Akbar. To continue the legacy of the discipline in which our state was forged, the Sultan should order the construction of a grand military academy in the capital, which will both honor his forefather and serve as a training ground for thousands of future conscripts and volunteers."
 naz_military_infrastructure_title: "Military Infrastructure"
 naz_military_infrastructure_desc: "The army that powers our Sultanate requires men to sustain its size. The casualties of war and retirement of veterans periodically result in manpower shortages. To rectify this, we should construct military training fields throughout the realm, along with free housing in barracks for any who volunteer into our service. Surely this will ensure a steady flow of fresh blood for our growing war machine."
 naz_black_banner_title: "The Black Banner"
 naz_black_banner_desc: "Without our presence, the chroniclers tell us, the safety of the Islamic world would not be nearly as secured as it is now. The increasing confidence of our subjects and those abroad in our ability to defend the faithful from harm and launch incursions into heathen territory has imbued our soldiers with unprecedented levels of morale. United, they are truly fit to be called the Sword of Islam."
 naz_protect_hajj_title: "Protect the Hajj"
 naz_protect_hajj_desc: "Our state is steadily growing to encompass an increasingly more vast swath of the Islamic world. For this reason, we must ensure that our road system is protected and developed so that the faithful may travel from far and wide to Mecca to complete their Hajj."
 naz_alexandria_title: "Pearl of the Mediterranean"
 naz_alexandria_desc: "[358.GetName] is one of the grandest cities in the world already, but to challenge the power of the European states and prove our status to other Muslim powers, we must make sure that it is a metropolis on par with its own classical iteration, home to untold riches and the greatest monuments to be seen anywhere."
 naz_library_title: "Restore the Library"
 naz_library_desc: "In the Hellenistic period, after Iskandar's conquest of Egypt, a massive library was constructed in Alexandria which housed the world's largest collection of books, scrolls, and other recorded knowledge. Sadly, this palace of learning was destroyed sometime during Roman Rule in Egypt. To reverse the barbarous actions of its destroyers, we must erect a new library and invite scholars from across the world to contribute works new and old to populate its shelves."
 naz_advisor_title: "Sultan's Court"
 naz_advisor_desc: "No state can function without effective administrators. Accordingly, our Sultan must surround himself with trustworthy and intelligent advisors, loyal enough not to plot his downfall, but independent enough to challenge the Sultan when he is wrong, so that he may be a just and disciplined ruler."
 naz_suez_title: "Highway of the Sultanate"
 naz_suez_desc: "Since time immemorial, the Levant and Africa have been united only by an infinitesimal stretch of land between Egypt and the Sinai peninsula. Our engineers and sailors have recently suggested that modern technology is advanced enough to create a grand canal that will connect the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean, reducing travel distance by thousands of miles. Imagine the profit that could be generated not just by the trade that would flow through this canal, but also by taxing foreign fleets seeking to pass through the new tollgate of world trade! We must immediately begin construction."
 naz_levantine_trade_title: "Levantine Trade"
 naz_levantine_trade_desc: "Despite all the profit there is to seek in India, the Far East, and Africa, there truly is no place like home. The loyal merchants of Syria and Egypt maintain a millennia-old exchange based around grain and cotton that continues to this day. We should capitalize on the volume of trade within the homeland."
 naz_delta_title: "Breadbasket of Nile"
 naz_delta_desc: "The Nile Delta is home to grain fields that fed the entire Mediterranean and beyond at the Roman Empire's height. We are certain that with enough expansion of the existing irrigation systems, we will be able to recreate the fields that once earned the Nile Delta the title of Breadbasket."
 naz_textile_title: "Expand the Textile Industry"
 naz_textile_desc: "The conversion of raw silk and cloth from the east into textiles and clothing is fast becoming one of the most profitable industries in the world. We should take advantage of the vast supply of raw cotton and silk we produce and import to manufacture textiles that can be sold to Europe at extravagant prices."
 naz_industrialize_title: "Industrialize the Sultanate"
 naz_industrialize_desc: "Across the world, the fires of industry are roaring, and we will not be left behind. The massive grain, textile, and mining industries we already facilitate must be modernized and expanded. We will charter state corporations to oversee the creation of new factories across the Sultanate so that we may continue to have a dominant and competitive economy, not reliant on anyone else's imports."
 naz_granary_title: "Granary of the World"
 naz_granary_desc: "In the Nile Delta, we already produce some of the highest yields of grain in the world, but with modern irrigation and advancements in agricultural technology, we can expand the fields to produce more grain in less time and with less human labor. We will flood foreign markets with such high volumes of grain that they will find it pointless to grow their own, making the Nile Delta the granary of the entire world and giving the Sultanate powerful leverage in future trade deals."

 ab_jerusalem.2.a: "Understood"
 ab_jerusalem.3.t: "Timed Mission Failed"
 ab_jerusalem.3.d: "We have failed to complete 'The Triumph of the Cross' timed mission, therefore the mission will be permanently removed from our mission tree."
 ab_jerusalem.3.a: "Unfortunate"
 ab_jerusalem.5.t: "The Latin Empire"
 ab_jerusalem.5.d: "At last, elusive Anatolia and its beating heart, the City of the World's Desire, belong to the good and Christian world once more. Even as we deliberate and celebrate, work is still being done - Saracen idols being cast down, churches propped up, faithful Christian nobles raising their banners, all in the pursuit of making these lands pure once more. As the work goes on, however, we wonder whether it is best to delegate our newest acquisition to our finest young nobles, modestly reviving the old memory of the Latin Empire as to alleviate ourselves of administrative burden, or proudly incorporate Constantinople into our growing crown..."
 ab_jerusalem.5.a: "Constantinople is ours!"
 ab_jerusalem.5.b: "We shall establish the Latin Empire!"
 ab_jerusalem.6.t: "Fate of Islam"
 ab_jerusalem.6.d: "'Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth' - so said Christ in his sermon on the Mount of Beatitudes. Over a thousand years later, we stand here today gazing out over the Holy Lands we have waged a bitter war to acquire and wonder if we are truly the meek that he spoke of. Are they meek, the powerful men who unsheathe their blade only in eager response, ready to vanquish evil so that it may never have to be unsheathed again? Or are they not the wise men who choose peace first, keeping their blades still in their scabbards, hoping that the innocent may prove themselves innocent, regardless of creed? Today, we must decide - is Islam a monstrous enemy, or an error to be treated with mercy and acceptance, brothers loved regardless?"

 ab_jerusalem.7.d: "A very talented nobleman from Oversticht has come to the courts attention! This Pious man seems to have a keen eye for State and Millitary affairs and wishes to use his ingenuity for the good of Christendom. A man born of higher standing in the Bishopric of Utrecht, he decided to dedicate his life to his faith. At a young age he read about great men such as Constantine, Charlemagne, Invictus and Leon Gabras and set his sights towards being remembered like these men. So he left everything behind and set sail to the Holy Kingdom to conquer for the one true God. After rising up the army ranks multiple officials and soldiers have contacted the king to suggest giving Enzo a promotion to a higher rank. A few Nobles have even suggested that with the Nizzar menace looming it's time for desperate measures and that we need fresh blood. The future of the Kingdom is uncertain and the court decideds that..."

 koj_fate_nonbelievers_desc: "The Holy Land and the wastes beyond are rife with non-believers. Followers of faiths unholy, unjust, and outright bizarre, file through the marketplaces.

The good word teaches tolerance - but should we let these lost souls suffer in ignorance when they could instead know the good shepherd?"
 koj_king_doge_title: "The Doge and the King"
 koj_king_doge_desc: "The Venetians have long been masters of the sea - masters best-kept allies. The quality of their craft is unmatched and their reputation is impressive.

 koj_land_of_moses_title: "The Land of Moses"

 koj_fate_of_islam_title: "Fate of Islam"

From the Sinai to the Euphrates, Israelites to Elamites, Jesus shall be known!"
 koj_seleucia_title: "Patriarchate of Seleucia"
 koj_seleucia_desc: "Mesopotamia is a land ancient and wise. Before Christ even walked the Earth, these lands were rich, fertile and wise. Recent centuries have rendered a region renowned as a barbarous, unhinged and unloved wasteland - a cradle of bastardisation, not civilisation. Let us establish, according to the footsteps and precedent of past conquerors, the Patriarchate of Seleucia, to bring Christ's word to these vile lands!"
 koj_timur_title: "In Timur's Footsteps"

 koj_contol_trade_title: "Control the Naval Trade"
 koj_contol_trade_desc: "Unfortunately, the Mediterranean, for many centuries now, has fallen beneath the shady and vile veil of heathen supremacy.

 koj_legions_of_christendom_title: "Legions of Christendom"
 koj_legions_of_christendom_desc: "The armies of Christ can never truly rest, not while heathens and heretics still threaten the faithful. Should a threat big enough appear that could threaten both our existence, and the existence of the church as a whole, then it is our sacred duty to God and Christ to annihilate the armies of the damned. A Grand Crusade shall be called to destroy the threats once and for all."
 koj_global_crusade_title: "The Grand Crusade"
 koj_global_crusade_desc: "The time is right, the prayers have been read aloud in front of our brave soldiers. All that remains is for us to crush the heathens that dare challenge almighty God. This endeavour will take the greatest military minds and bravest men to see through, but God will not allow us to falter." 
 koj_seljuk_title: "Defeat Seljuk's Descendants" 
 koj_seljuk_desc: "The Seljuks were once the scourge of Christendom, and their initial invasion of the holy land is what triggered the initial crusades. Now, the Seljuks and their splinter states are mere shadows of their once grand empire. It would be God’s work to wipe them off the face of the map." 
 koj_avenge_fourth_crusade_title: "Avenge the Fourth Crusade"
 koj_avenge_fourth_crusade_desc: "The unfortunate failure of the Fourth Crusade was a major tactical blunder in the history of the crusades. The Crusaders had almost conquered the city of the world's desire for the Pope, but poor planning and even poorer tactics resulted in a staggering defeat. Now that we are the main force of a renewed crusade, we can rectify the failures of the past for a better future for Christianity." 
 koj_latin_empire_title: "The Latin Empire" 
 koj_latin_empire_desc: "The Empire of the Romans in the East has always been heretical in the eyes of the true followers of Christ. The mighty Eastern Roman Empire has now fallen from grace, and our continued conquests in the east have granted us some legitimacy as the successor to the old empire. The Pope has approached offering us an opportunity to crown our ruler as the true ruler of the Roman Empire in the East." 
 koj_outremer_nation_title: "The Outremer Nation" 
 koj_outremer_nation_desc: "A major cultural shift has occurred in our lands. Instead of being a land of Arabs ruled over by the French, it is now a land of a new culture referred to by outside historians as Outremer. Mixtures of customs and languages are all tied together by a common faith in Catholicism. Expanding this new culture into our administration and to our lands will unite these once disunited lands." 
 koj_crusader_fortifications_title: "Crusader Fortifications"
 koj_crusader_fortifications_desc: "Our lands are filled with we people who do not enjoy being ruled by us, and our neighbours all seek to destroy our kingdom. Maintaining our current amount of forts will only lead to inevitable downfall. Forts must be constructed and developed across the land to ensure that we do not fall to both inwards strife and outwards invasion." 
 koj_krak_des_chevaliers_title: "Krak des Chevaliers"
 koj_krak_des_chevaliers_desc: "The lands of Tripoli are the most defensible position in all of the Holy Land. The location is perfect for us to finance and construct the grandest series of fortifications and defences known to God. No Saracen will ever dare invade us once they see our awe-inspiring might." 
 koj_cultivate_the_holy_land_title: "Cultivate the Holy Land"
 koj_cultivate_the_holy_land_desc: "Centuries of crusading has turned the Holy Land into devastated hellscape comparable to the lands of England back in Europe. And while the conversion of the locals has been mostly successful, they still whine and complain about the abysmal standard of living. Giving minor concessions and ensuring that there are farms for them to work on to make a living might revitalise our economy." 
 koj_markets_of_tyre_title: "Markets of Tyre" 
 koj_markets_of_tyre_desc: "The city of Tyre was once the producer of the legendary Tyrian Dye that was desired by even the grandest of rulers in antiquity. Although the dye trade has since fallen off, the city still has some infrastructure to become the biggest port in the Mediterranean. It just takes a little investment and advertising and then the profits will start rolling in." 
 koj_jewel_of_orient_title: "Jewel of the Orient" 
 koj_jewel_of_orient_desc: "Jerusalem is the most significant city in the Near East, unfortunately, it is dwarfed in size compared to other major metropolises across the world. It deserves a proper renovation to truly be considered the capital of the Kingdom of God. New churches, markets, and workshops will launch it into the future of urbanisation and industrialisation."
 koj_holy_sepulchre_title: "Church of the Holy Sepulchre" 
 koj_holy_sepulchre_desc: "The holiest of all churches in Catholicism is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and while it is sacred to all Christians, it is a tad small compared to other churches in the world. While we could go and build a new church and tear down the old one and claim it was in the wrong place, it would look better in the eyes of God if we gave the old church a renovation to bring it up to par with other cathedrals." 
 koj_holy_alliance_title: "Forge the Holy Alliance" 
 koj_holy_alliance_desc: "The most holy nation on the planet is the Papal States themselves in Rome. To truly feel closer to God and to bring his vision to life on Earth, we must consult with the pope and ensure that our plans align to better the life of Catholics everywhere." 
 koj_invite_western_scholars_title: "Invite Western Scholars"
 koj_invite_western_scholars_desc: "Scholars back home in the West have thought up some new philosophies and ideas during our time crusading. Some of these ideas are questionably Pagan in nature, but they also produce beautiful paintings and provide better ways to organise a state. So we will have to cherry-pick what works and what we do not want, but we cannot deny these ideas." 
 koj_patronize_art_title: "Patronise Religious Art" 
 koj_patronize_art_desc: "The artistry of the Renaissance is the most beautiful that anyone has laid eyes upon. A few fools damned to hell have painted paintings of Pagan gods who defy Christ. As a response, we will commission one hundred paintings depicting stories from the Bible and the life of Jesus for every one of their so-called masterpieces about Venus." 
 koj_colleges_title: "Pontifical Colleges" 
 koj_colleges_desc: "Universities that can teach our heirs and other important government magistrates the ways of Christ and rulership will greatly increase our capabilities to conquer heathens. There is no shortage of learned men in the Kingdom, we just have to bring them together." 
 koj_interfaith_unity_title: "Interfaith Unity" 
 koj_interfaith_unity_desc: "It would be impossible for us to truly remove the stain of the Saracens from our lands. They are just too stubborn to ever give in. Perhaps it would be better to accept these differences and bring all peoples of our Kingdom together to strengthen our realm against invaders. After all, we are all sons of Abraham"
