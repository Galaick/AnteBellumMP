 string_start_title_andalusia: "The Caliphate of Al-Andalus"
 string_start_andalusia: "The Iberian Peninsula was conquered by the §YUmayyads§! in year 711. The Berber and Arabic armies quickly defeated the weakened §YVisigothic Kingdom§! and brought most of Iberia under their control. Their triumph against the Visigoths encouraged them to march north, into the land of the §YFranks§!. What seemed like a promising military campaign turned into a complete disaster during the §YBattle of Tours§!. The decisive Frankish victory forced the Umayyad armies to withdraw from Francia. Their victory halted the Muslim expansion in Europe and led to an everlasting rivalry between Francia and the Muslim rulers of Iberia. \n \n While the Umayyads in Iberia were consolidating their rule, the Umayyad Caliphate based around §YDamascus§! and §YHarran§! was overthrown during the so called §YAbassid§! revolution of 750. Most of the princes who were the descendants of the last Caliph were massacred in the aftermath of the revolution. Only the young prince §YAbd al-Rahman§! managed to escape the Abassids and fled to Iberia. There, with the help of those still loyal to the Umayyads, he managed to seize power and became the Sultan of Andalusia. \n \nIn 912, his descendat, §YAbd al-Rahman III§! became the ruler. His reign marked the beginning of a golden age for Al-Andalus. The country became the center of science, law and education. During this period, Abd al-Rahman III declared himself the rightful §YCaliph§! in the face of the falling Abassids. He also built the palace complex of Medina Azhara, was exceptionally tolerant towards the Christian and Jewish population of Iberia and was trying to keep good relations with other European powers. \n \n The centuries following his reign were the centuries of prosperity and growth. Andalusia only faced minor conflicts against the Franks and the Christian Iberian Kingdoms in the north. This amounted to minor territorial exchanges and monetary payments. Al-Andalus did not experience any major conflicts, until very recently.\n \nIn 1443, the treacherous Franks and their subjects formed a coalition against Andalusia. With the blessing of the Pope himself, they crossed the Pyrenees and launched a crusade against us. The scale of the conflict was something that the region did not experience in centuries. The northern regions of Andalusia were devastated by the wrath of the crusaders. The crusade culminated in the §YBattle of Valencia§!, where our armies clashed with the Frankish army led by the Emperor himself. The battle turned out to be a disaster for the Franks. Both their Emperor and his son, the only successor, were killed. Losses on both sides were so heavy that this pyrrhic victory for Andalusia marked the end of the crusade, as both sides were unable to continue fighting. \n \nNow that the fighting is over, we must recover from this disaster and hope for the better days ahead."
 string_start_title_ruthenia: "Heirs of Ruthenia"
 string_start_ruthenia: "Following the passing of §YYaroslav the Wise§! in AD 1054, the §YKievan Rus’§! found itself dismantled amidst a bitter succession, leaving Ruthenia severely weakened and disunited amidst a sea of growing troubles. Hoping to restore past glories, the Rus’ numerous princes instead preferred to wage bloody, fratricidal wars against one another. Alas, as a consequence of these desperately brutish attempts to press their ever-diluting claims to Kiev, the descendants of Rurik's great legacy reduced the very prize they had been eyeing to a pathetic shadow of its former self.\n\nFurther piling woes upon the shoulders of Ruthenia, the sickly Kievan Rus’ and a half dozen other principalities had chosen to aid the §YCumans§! against an enigmatic, seemingly unstoppable invader in AD 1223. Despite ensuring their best men were sallied out for war, the Ruthenian and Cuman forces suffered a savage defeat by the §YMongols§! at the §YBattle of Kalka§! in the spring of that year; of every ten Ruthenian soldiers who fought at the Kalka River, only one would return home alive.\n\nThis crushing defeat at the hands of an as-yet unknown opponent irreparably weakened the Ruthenian princes, depriving them of much needed manpower and leadership, thus cementing a steeper decline for Ruthenia. The final nail in the coffin arrived upon the Mongol Invasion of Ruthenia in AD 1237, when §YSubutai§! commanded an overwhelming strike against the numerous principalities, crushing most meaningful resistance by AD 1240, and forcing §YNovgorod§! to pay tribute.\n\nOf course, with the growing instability inside the Mongol Empire, the strangling grip of the §YTatar Yoke§! soon began to wither. The §YGolden Horde§!, which had extracted tribute from and routinely terrorised the Ruthenians for a century, would enter sharp decline in the 14th century. Despite maintaining a semblance of territorial integrity, the Golden Horde was no longer capable of ensuring harmony amongst its already unruly and disloyal tributaries.\n\nProvided with this breath of fresh air, the Ruthenians saw fit not to unite against and finally overthrow their despised slave drivers, but rather to spill one another's blood over which principality ought to reunite the Rus’. §YVladimir§! - favourite of the Mongol Empire - was the first of these to fall, being sundered by half a dozen rivals, with §YPolotsk§! and §YGalicia-Volhynia§! following soon after. Powerless to stop them, all the Golden Horde could do was sit idly by as its rebellious subjects began the long process of consolidation, and the tax income dried up.\n\nDespite the Golden Horde being pushed back by princely coalitions at the rivers §YOka§! and §YKharkov§! in AD 1408 and 1409 respectively, the Tatar Yoke remains around Ruthenia's neck, if only loosely. Despite increasing efforts in §YNovgorod§!, §YMuscovy§!, and §YKiev§! to commence the fatal struggle, progress has been marred by the Golden Horde's refusal to die. If the §YHeirs of Ruthenia§! are to tear off the last shackles which bind them to the Khan, they must band together, or die together, lest the vastness of Rus’ devours them." 
 string_start_title_bohemian: "The Kingdom of Bohemia"
 string_start_bohemian: "Though Great Moravia was mighty indeed, it §Ycollapsed§! under its own weight after the §Ydeath of Svatopluk§! in 894. A young §YSpytihnev§! took the reins of the Bohemian crown and §Ybroke free§! from Moravian control; it is said that he appeared in the §YImperial Diet of 895§! in Regensburg, and swore a pledge of loyalty to §YEmperor Bernard§!, paving the way for help and protections against the Magyars, in exchange for tribute to the Carolingians, culminating in the decisive §YBattle of Preslava§! in 907 which freed Bohemia from the §YMagyar menace§! for a time. During Otto I's reign, the §YBattle of Lechfeld§! in 955 annihilated the remnants, thus giving Bohemia reprieve from the merciless raids in their eastern territories. With German aid gained from marching against the Magyars, the §YPremyslids§! sidelined their own nobility, and struck a powerful blow in 995 that significantly §Ycentralised their power§!.\n\nThe year 1002 marked a §Yturning point§! for Bohemia, its lands enfeoffed to Duke Vladivoj, finally integrating the duchy into the Empire. The decades afterwards were marked with conflict against the northern pagans, being humiliated in the 1055 invasion of Silesia that resulted in the duke's death. After this, Bohemia entered into a period of relative peace and prosperity, hailed by some as its §Ygolden age§! of culture and development. The dynasties of the Carolingians and Premyslids became further intertwined with a series of politically convenient royal marriages, resulting in Ottokar I being named the hereditary King of Bohemia in 1198. This was only further affirmed by the §YGolden Bull of Aachen in 1212§!, enshrining its status as a kingdom.\n\nThe Premyslids were §Yhated by many§! other European houses due to their ties with the Carolingians, and so the §Yassassination of Wenceslaus III§! in 1306 ended the dynasty, with the House of Luxembourg quickly swooping in to take over. The §YGolden Bull of 1356§! turned Bohemia into an elector, increasing their power and prestige significantly. However, growing resentment and criticism of the church exploded into violent tension with the rising popularity of §YJan Hus, and his Hussite movement§!. The conflict lasted between 1419 to 1434, ending in the moderate Hussites accepting §YBohemian rule and Catholic dominion§!, being allowed to practise their rites in peace.\n\nThe end of the war was marked by the appointment of a §Ynew dynasty§! - the Hohenstaufens - under King Rudolph, younger brother to the Lotharingian King Frederick III. His §Yunpopular reign§! is marked with the attempt to §Yre-Catholicise§! Bohemia and §Ybanish the Hussites§!. Though partly successful, they still hold major sway in the city of Prague itself, and while Rudolph has the estates on his side, Francia is once again §Yfalling apart§! at the seams, led by an incompetent emperor. Now Bohemia, as a nation and as a people, stand at the crossroads. Will they §Yreturn to the Pope§!, or will they reject the authority of Rome, and adopt a §YSecond Reformation§!? Will they fully integrate with the Germans they have surrounded themselves with for centuries, or will they pridefully retain their cultures and traditions?"
 string_start_baltics: "The Baltics are a vast, untamed land on the periphery of ‘civilized’ Europe. The people of these lands are fierce, independent and resistant to any outside influence. This is one of the few remaining §YPagan§! strongholds in Europe, where the §YOld Gods§! still rule. \n \n The people who live in these lands are distantly related to the §YSlavs§!, but they make up their own, distinct group. The §YBalts§! are divided into several different tribes, ruled by chiefs, kings and dukes. The land is rich in natural resources, but the most important one of these is amber. This is where the ancient §YAmber Road§! started, and this made it very wealthy. \n \n Surrounding realms may have converted to §YChristianity§!, but the people of the Baltic remained steadfast in their beliefs of the Old Gods, and none more than the §YLithuanians§!, the most powerful of the Baltic realms. They are determined to protect their homeland from any outside invaders, wherever they may be from. §YPruthenia§! in the southwest is another powerful realm with close ties to the §YPoles§! and the §YPolabian§! Slavs. To the north lies §YLivonia§!, a fellow Baltic tribe that managed to preserve its independence despite all the hardships it faced in history. Even further to the north, lies §YEstonia§!, a land whose people are very distinct and remarkable in that they are not related to the Balts. They are of a different stock and worpship different, albeit similar gods. \n \n These rich lands have been attracting traders since antiquity. German merchants from the §YHansa§! have established many contacts in the region. The 13th century saw the founding of many trading outposts on the shores, some of which grew into cities, strongholds of Christian German culture far from the homeland. The most prominent of these are §YDanzig§! and §YRiga§!. The Balts were cordial in their relations with these cities, as trade was beneficial to both sides, but lately, following religious upheaval in the §YHoly Roman Empire§!, they have been the destination of many far more zealous immigrants. Relations cooled until they finally became outright hostile. The people of the German outposts have been whipped into a religious frenzy and they are intent on bringing the Word of God to these heathen savages. \n \n The zealous Germans are intent on making the Balts give up their false gods and the Balts are determined to destroy the foreign invaders, like they have done many times before. The fate of the Baltic is unsure, and the future is uncertain. Will one of the last pagan strongholds in Europe fall to the warriors of God, or will its people drive back the invaders and keep their faith in the Old Gods? One thing is certain, many lives will the be lost in an ungodly war."

 string_start_title_francia: "Carolingian West Francia"
 string_start_francia: "The Kingdom of the Franks is an enduring yet troubled realm, born from the ashes of the §YWestern Roman Empire§! in the 5th Century AD and driven by a desire to restore the Old Order. The efforts of the legendary §YCharles Martel, Pepin the Short,§! and §YCharlemagne§! saw Francia’s rulers declared the Emperors of the Romans at the dawn of the 9th Century. Unfortunately, a vast slew of issues would begin to form rifts within the state. After the death of Charlemagne’s son §YLouis the Pious§! in AD 840, most Carolingian Emperors would begin their reigns with piling crises and crude territorial partitions, all the while in their forefathers’ shadows. §YCharles the Fat’s§! reign in the late 9th century brought a new time of troubles, and upon the succession of his son §YBernard I§! in AD 888, these cracks began to show.\n\nAt the end of Bernard’s shaky reign in AD 924, his sons Pepin, Charles, and Lothair plunged Francia into decades of civil war over their inheritance. Fearful of what would occur if the troubles in Francia spread across the Rhine, in AD 925 the nobles and clergy named Saxon duke §YOtto Liudolfinger§! as Emperor. To prevent a Carolingian resurgence, Emperor Otto and his successors did their utmost to curb Frankish influence and erode the Carolingian powerbase, splitting off §YLotharingia§! and §YArles§!. They were not destined for a place in the sun, however; just shy of a century after Otto’s usurpation, from §YAD 1014-1024§! the Ottonians were eclipsed by the very realm they sought to bring under heel, fading into the annals of history and their holdings reduced to cinders.\n\nAlthough the Carolingians regained the Emperorship, their misfortunes were far from over. In AD 1101, Emperor Charles V was forced to cede §YCalais§! to the English after a failed campaign to avenge 1066, and over the next several centuries, the emperors’ relationships with their Ducal subjects in Germany grew strained. This ultimately came to a head in AD 1356, when Emperor Lothair II capitulated to pressure and issued a §YGolden Bull§! in Aachen, establishing the Prince-Electorates at the cost of debasing Frankish prestige. Following this great humiliation were the §YHussite Wars§!, which ravaged Bohemia from AD 1419-1434, §Yending on uncertain terms§! with an unpopular king in Prague seated amidst a sea of secret heretics.\n\nNot even a decade later came the §YIberian Crusade§! of AD 1443 where, despite the full might of the Empire brought to bear, only ruin lay ahead. The war met its crescendo in the bloody §YBattle of Valencia§!, which proved to be a crushing blow against Christendom. §YEmperor Francis and his son lay dead§!, and the mortified Imperial armies recoiled in disbelief, withdrawing from Iberia. The Prince Electors naturally settled on §YLothair III§! of Francia, the last full-blooded descendant of Charlemagne, though his lack of issue bodes ill, while his poor character and post war concessions left his image in tatters. The final hours of the Carolingians may soon be dawning. Can Lothair save his bloodline and realm, or will he fall in the pursuit of Charlemagne’s fleeting glory like so many before?"
 string_start_lothar: "A §Ypatchwork§! of disunited ethnicities and feudal holdings, §YLotharingia§! was initially intended to be the inheritance of §YLouis the Pious’§! eldest son, §YLothair§!.

Succeeded in turn by his son §YLouis the Stammerer§! and grandson §YCarloman§!, the throne ultimately passed to §YCharles the Fat of East Francia in 881§!, the last emperor to have a stable succession when his sole heir was proclaimed §YEmperor Bernard I in 888§!. Upon Bernard’s own death in §Y924§!, the Lotharingian plan was intended to be revived, the kingdom granted to his middle son, §YLothair§!, while the others would receive §YWest and East Francia§!.\n\nAlas, Bernard’s sons went §Yagainst his will§!, fighting for dominance over their siblings. §YCharles§!, Bernard’s primary heir, rallied the §YParisian nobility§! to his side, §YPepin§! fled to §YLombardy§!, and §YLothair§! arrived in §YLotharingia§!. The §YCarolingian Succession War§! threatened to spill into §YGermany§! as Lothair, outnumbered and desperate, beseeched the dukes of East Francia to support him in taking the Imperial throne. His bid failed, and the Germans instead turned to one of their own, §YOtto Luidolfinger§!, who then led a series of punitive wars against the Francians to secure German dominance and neuter their influence. Upon the campaign's conclusion, Middle Francia was §Ydissolved§!; the §YRhine§! was reconstituted into §YFranconia§!, whereas Lotharingia was separated from the §YFrankish Crown§! in §Y930§!, with Otto enthroning the §YNibelungs§! - a German cadet branch of the Carolingians - to ensure closer cooperation with §YAachen§!.\n\nLotharingia, now §Ylapsed out of the Empire§!, has just barely survived the tribulations of history, rarely by merit of its kings and greatly weakened, having lost the §YLow Countries§! in a series of §Yrevolts§! from §Y988-1000§!. During the uninspiring reign of §YRudolf ‘the Simple’ Nibelung in the 1210s§!, the §YHohenstaufens of Swabia§! emerged as the strongest opposition to the throne. The nobles quickly gravitated to the vigorous and wealthy magnate §YRoland of Swabia§!, and it wasn’t long before a §Ybloodless coup§! drove the Nibelungs from the Kingdom. However, Roland’s reign was §Ytarnished§! by his illegitimate seizure of power, and his heirs regressed to the inefficacy of the Nibelungs, driving the briefly roused Lotharingia once more into §Ystagnancy§!.\n\nReduced at times to spewing grand proclamations of their might and power, the Lotharingians simultaneously do whatever possible to keep §YCarolingian armies§! from ending the Middle Francian state. It seems, for now, that the §YEmpire’s bulwark§! against Frankish machinations has failed, although the fate of nations is infamously fickle. With the incumbent §YRoland V§!’s dear cousins reigning in §YSwabia and Bohemia§!, the Hohenstaufen kingdom might even §Yreenter the Empire§!.

 string_start_wallachia: "The Vlachs have had to endure foreign rule for much longer than the Principality of Wallachia has existed, bending to the whims of foreign sovereigns rather than their own as the tributaries to many a horde and empire. First breaking from the §YMongol§! and §YCuman§! Hordes in the 13th Century, they soon found themselves under much tighter rule with the §YMagyars’§! expansion in the 14th Century. This continued until the early 15th Century, in which the Magyar-Bulgar wars over Danubian hegemony weakened them enough for the §YHouse of Basarab§! to seize their opportunity for independence. \n \n After raising the banners, a great Vlach rebellion alongside their Moldavian cousins pried the grips of Magyar and Bulgar alike off of the Vlach crowns - at least for a time. This was not the end of the conflicts though, as the infighting among the Basarab dynasty saw the two cadet branches - §YDraculesti§! and §YDanesti§! - vying for control over the entire Principality at the other’s expense. Having assumed that they were weakened by their own freedom, the Magyars attempted a final strike in the 1430s. Despite the Magyars being promised an early victory, the Draculestis had managed to secure Wallachia with §YByzantine§! gold and place one of their own, Vlad II - a member of the prestigious §YOrder of the Dragon§! - on the throne. \n \n Militarily quick-thinking, Vlad II used his small and mobile army’s knowledge of their terrain to harass the invaders until they buckled and called for peace. Now the year is 1444, and the Principality of Wallachia has recently been enjoying its first taste of peace in a long time. This may not last much longer, however, as the greedy glares of the Magyars and Bulgars turn once again to the East side of the Carpathians. As well as this, there have been calls among noble and commoner alike for a greater Vlach state; a union with §YMoldavia§! and perhaps - God willing - §YTransylvania§!. Wallachia’s destiny as of yet remains unclear, though an especially capable ruler may be what the Vlachs need to earn their place in the annals of history. They have certainly faced worse..."
 string_start_title_moldavia: "The Principality of Moldavia"
 string_start_moldavia: "The Principality of Moldavia, akin to its cousins in §YWallachia§!, has been the subject of many a foreign power for as long as it has been around and then some. Oftentimes the Vlach Principalities have even existed simultaneously, albeit under different overlords altogether. That being said, Moldavia was generally the one dealt greater blows by its oppressors due to its closer proximity to the frontier between Christendom and the pagans. Facing raids and demands for tribute from Slavs, Magyars, Cumans, Mongols, and even a few rogue Hussites and Byzantine pretenders, there have been no shortage of struggles for this rugged people. \n \n At an earlier time than many, Moldavia broke from the yoke of the §YGreat Horde§! and only briefly remained under §YMagyar§! rule - much to the envy of the Wallachians. This did render them more vulnerable to incursions by §YSlavic§! raiders, on the other hand, and by the beginning of the 15th Century there was a significant Slavic minority within the Principality’s borders. Further troubles began when religious persecutions by pagans saw a vast influx of §YCatholic§! refugees into the primarily §YOrthodox§! state and - to top it all off - when the §YHussite§! heretics made their way to the Vlach principalities in a long and arduous trek, they began to cement themselves in communities and cliques much to the clergy’s even greater dismay. \n \n Moldavia is currently backed into a corner by its woes. Few can deny that the enemies it faces on all sides are great in number. Even the Wallachians, who were once on good terms with Moldavia, have begun to see the commoners as more Slavic and Catholic than the Orthodox Vlachs the nobility are comprised of. Their calls for unification are backed by a number of the nobility, who seek to remove themselves from the threat of foreign rule once again. There are more still, however, who would sooner see Moldavia lead such a union, claiming the Wallachians are too short-sighted and abrasive to lead such a worthy cause. If they aren’t careful, the Moldavians may not have the breathing room to make such a choice on their own, though..."

 string_start_moravia: "Formerly the proud hegemon of Western Slavs and the cultural centre of the Slavic world, Moravia is nothing but a shade of its former self. Centuries ago, Moravia was a vast realm stretching from §YLusatia§! to §YTisa§!, and from §YVistula§! to §YDrava§!, however, it has now been reduced to a fraction of its former size, controlling only its two founding principalities of §YMoravia§! and §YNitra§!.\n\nIn §Y863§!, the Byzantine missionaries §YConstantine§! and §YMethodius§! were sent to Moravia upon the initiative of its duke §YRostislav§!. Their mission saw the creation of the §YGlagolitic§! alphabet, as well as the translation of the most important liturgical books into §YSlavonic§!. Their efforts led to the recognition of Slavonic as the fourth official liturgical language, alongside Hebrew, Greek and Latin. This period was a cultural golden age, as Moravia quickly became the cultural centre of the Slavic world.\n\nMoravia reached the height of its power during the reign of §YSvatopluk§! in the late 9th century. Svatopluk ended the cultural golden age by expelling the theologians educated by §YConstantine§! and §YMethodius§!, thus bringing the country under the Bishop of Rome’s jurisdiction. Svatopluk was proclaimed §Y’Rex Sclavorum’§! by the Pope, and with his blessing, he subjugated the surrounding Slavic tribes, becoming the undisputed regional hegemon.\n\nHowever, this did not last long. Following Svatopluk’s death, the throne in Veligrad was claimed by his eldest son §YMojmír II§!, whose reign saw the disintegration of the empire which Svatopluk had spent his life building. The subjugated Slavic tribes and duchies quickly regained their independence, and the final blow came from the invading §YMagyar§! hordes, who were relentlessly raiding and pillaging the entirety of Pannonia, until they were finally defeated by a combined §YFranco-Moravian§! force during the §YBattle of Preslava§! in §Y907§! AD.\n\nAlthough Mojmír prevented the total collapse of the country, Moravia lost everything except for its core lands. During the later years of his reign, Mojmír reinvited the disciples expelled by his father, and under the guidance of §YGorazd§!, the Archbishop of Moravia, the country was reverted back to the Slavonic rite. Despite the attempts of the Bavarian clergy to regain Moravia for the Roman jurisdiction, no real effort was made, as the Empire was far more concerned with the §YMuslims§! strangling their southern borders. The bond between Rome and Veligrad was finally broken in §Y1054§! during the §YGreat Schism§!, when §YBorislav I§! sided with §YConstantinople§! and rejected Pope’s authority.\n\nSince then, Moravia spend the last centuries as a buffer state wedged between the Holy Roman Empire and the Pagans surrounding it. The times grow more dire as her lands are eyed hungrily by the Magyars, who are preparing to cross the Danube, as well as the German counts who may also be eager to exploit Moravia’s weakened position. Will Moravia collapse and be replaced by new, ascendant nations, or will it survive and prosper, perhaps even to reclaim all the that was lost and resurrect Svatopluk’s legacy?"

 string_start_magyars: "Early §YMagyar§! history has proven an unclear and murky affair. Folk tales detail heroic conquests, utilised as the pretext to many a rampage. §YBulgar-Frankish§! accounts, as well as Byzantine observations, document a decades-long process of migration between §Y862§! and §Y895§!, predicated upon prior incursions by mercenaries. The Magyars first sent political shockwaves through Europe in §Y899's Battle of Virovitica§! - a storm of cavalry which saw Prince §YBraslav of Croatia§! decapitated in a devastating battle. Reeling in shock, Croatia retreated south - allowing the Magyars to ravage Pannonia with little resistance.\n\nBy §Y907§!, the situation had become untenable for adjacent §YMoravia§! and the burgeoning §YFranks§! to the west. Uniting, a Frankish-Moravian force obliterated a Magyar host led by the semi-mythical §YÁrpád§! at the Battle of §YPozsony§! - banishing the tribes, slaying mighty Árpád. Little since have the Magyars dared encroach upon Pannonia. An era known as the §Y'First Darkness'§! began - consisting of tribal infighting, lasting years. Via Frankish escort, wandering Irish monks crept into Carpathia amidst the chaos. Some disunited tribes proved receptive to preachers - thus resulting in a wave of conversion, spearheaded by a young tribal known as §YVajk§!, baptised and renamed §YStephen§!.\n\nIt would not last. Christianity in Carpathia was snuffed out by a rising §YKoppány the Wicked§! - shattering the fledgling Christians and impaling Stephen, reducing Catholicism to tiny enclaves. Koppany then glared upon §YPoland§!. Teeth sharpened, he tore the petty Poles to pieces until his death in 1024. In the decades following, his two feuding sons wrought havoc on the Slavic world.\n\nIn 1054, §YYaroslav the Wise§! of the ailing §YKievan Rus§! breathed his last breath. §YHuba the Tall§!, grandson to Koppany, viciously invaded, grinding half of Kiev to dust. Thus began Magyar domination of Ruthenia, dulled by occasional Slavic coalitions. Only in §Y1070§! did the Magyars quietly withdraw, having grown stagnant. The §Y'Second Darkness'§! ensued - lasting until §Y1139§!, when §YBéla the Bold§! restored order. Come §Y1161§!, his son §YCsaba§! pierced Bulgaria, sacking Tarnovo.

Rivalry was sparked between the two powers, whom raged over Russian subjects in a political game - won by neither side. As the Mongols waned, so too did the Magyars, falling into a §Y'Third Darkness'§!. §YZoltán the Fair§! whipped the tribes into a new frenzy come §Y1299§!. Expansion thus raged - §YRomania§! crumbling to her knees by §Y1315§!, rendered an oppressed subject. Only in a moment of Magyar weakness in §Y1357§!, struck by Bulgar incursions, did the Romanian localities crawl away. A Bulgar victory in §Y1364§! triggered Magyar decline proper.\n\nThe Magyars today stand on a precipice.

It was also in this battle where an unassuming young officer by the name of §YNizzar§! rose to prominence. Rallying the Egyptian forces in a daring - yet ultimately successful - counterattack, Nizzar would win the day for his Kurdish masters, securing the eternal loyalty of the Sultan's army.\n\nThe threat from abroad may have been dealt with, but alas, the already-precarious domestic situation rapidly deteriorated into the §YAyyubid Civil War§!. Nizzar, a freedman of both Masri and Coptic descent, found himself swayed by the plight of the average Egyptian. Growing increasingly discontent with the Ayyubids' rampant pillaging and wanton disregard for their subjects, he would - to the rapturous cheers of his troops - overthrow his liege and declare himself the rightful §YSultan of Egypt and the Levant§!.\n\nThe war would drag on until May of 1250, when the Ayyubid garrison at Cairo capitulated to Nizzar. Although his enemy took flight and wormed their way into §YSeljuk§! hands, what mattered to Nizzar was rebuilding the state - from the ground up. Justifying his regime with a merging of the Islamic Iskandar mythology and pan-Egyptian Pharaonic policies, the Nizzarid state quickly found friends in Leon Gabras' §YNicene§!

Abdulrahman’s sickly son Prince §Yal-Husayn§! was subsequently forced to accept a mockery of a peace treaty, ceding only a small strip of land in the northern Sinai and some war reparations.\n\nAl-Husayn reigned a mere 17 years, abdicating the throne in 1440 due to poor health induced by his drinking habits and severe stress from pulling the Sultanate from the brink of collapse in the aftermath of his father's unthinkable blunder. Succeeded by his only son, §YAbdul Jabbar§!, the Nizzarid state ought to be in safe hands, for this driven young man has grand ambitions for the future.\n\nIf he succeeds, he would wield the respect of the mighty Egyptian military in one hand, and the adoration of his subjects in the other.

The §YPiast§! king’s decision to convert to Christianity in the year 966 put Poland into a precarious position, as it was a Christian kingdom surrounded by Pagans to the East, West and the North. Its only Christian ally, §YGreat Moravia§!, was facing great crisis at the time, and it was unable to prevent the catastrophe that was about to happen. \n \n The Polish chieftains, devout in their faith to the gods, did not take kindly to the demands of baptism. They banded together to overthrow the king, but soon after this unstable coalition of opportunistic pagan chieftains collapsed. The following infighting not only failed to overthrow the Christian king, but it completely shattered the realm. Ever since, Poland has been divided between the descendants of these chieftains, constantly fighting each other in an ever-shifting net of alliances and intrigue. Not one of them was able to gain the upper hand however, and Poland remains disunited to this day. \n \n Greater Poland is ruled by the §YPolans§!, led by the Piast dynasty, descendants of the first and only king of Poland, §YMieszko§!. Even though it was his folly that broke the realm, they still maintain that theirs is the most legitimate claim to rule Poland. However, they inherited their ancestors’ problems too, as they are the only Christian realm in the area, surrounded by heathens on all sides. \n \n The §YVistulan§! tribe rules the south, surrounded by the jagged peaks of the Tatra mountains and the great river from which they take their name. They are a proud pagan people, ruling from one of the most important settlements in Poland, §YKrakow§!. \n \n To the north lies §YMazovia§!, ruled from the proud city of §YPlock§!. They occupy the flat plains of Central Poland, a prosperous region, where the Vistula flows slow, and the harvest is plentiful. They too follow the Old Gods and will undoubtedly try to unify their people for their glory. \n \n The §YLendians§! rule in the east of Poland. Their tribe has been exposed to the influence of the Rus’ for a long time, which is why they were the only other region to successfully Christianize, other than Greater Poland.

 string_start_jerusalem: "The continued existence of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem has been a hard-fought one. Since its inception in the wake of the §YFirst Crusade§!, the Kings of Jerusalem have been lodged between the Islamic powers of the Near East on one side, and their treacherous Crusader brethren on the other, just barely struggling from one conflict to the next. Jerusalem’s fortunes may have taken a turn for the better during the glorious reign of King §YBaudouin IV§! “the Great” d’Anjou, but this high bar for kingship was unable to be met by many of his successors. Many consecutive generations of incompetent kings plunged Jerusalem into chaos and crippling debt while its lands were snatched by the Islamic powers. It wasn’t until §YGuillaume d’Anjou§!, the youngest legitimate son of the previous king, took power in 1394 while his elder brother was captured by the §YNizzarids§! in their second invasion, that Jerusalem saw another glimmer of hope. \n \n Despite the tumultuous early years of Guillaume’s reign, he ultimately defeated the Nizzarid Sultanate decisively in several wars and gained Christendom a foothold in the Sinai for the first time since the short-lived success of the Fifth Crusade. King Guillaume had turned the tide against Jerusalem’s rivals in a way unmatched since the reign of Baudouin the Great, but it was at great personal cost. As the king lay dying from his wounds, he hoped that his son - still little more than an infant at the time - could someday carry on the d’Anjou legacy and help restore Christian rule to the Near East. \n \n Twelve years have passed since then. The year is 1444, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem is on the brink of another conflict with the ravenous Nizzarid Sultanate. Hellbent on avenging his father’s humiliating defeat in the last war, this new Sultan has brought an unprecedented level of energy and dedication - all in the name of destroying the last Crusader holdouts.

Coming out as the victor in most of the conflicts it has been drawn into have greatly lined not just the Doge’s - but also the republic’s - pockets, all the while fueling the merchants’ avaricious profiteering. While this has been the downfall of many a fellow Italian merchant republic, the opposite has just about always been true for the Venetians. If anything, their ever-growing desire for wealth beyond measure has seen to the merchant fleet’s near-uncontested dominion over the §YAdriatic Sea§! for several centuries. Some within Venice’s government even propose making additional attempts at territorial expansion within the wider Mediterannean or beyond.\n\n Even among Venice’s enemies, they are unable to deny it how impressively effective the small nation’s conquests have been. Throughout Europe in the Middle Ages, monarchies or land-based realms would most likely have raised peasant levies after harvesting season and deployed a handful of light ships to fight their wars. In contrast, Venice’s lack of expendable manpower and deep pockets allowed for it to sortie not only an entire merchant fleet, but also employ an imposing amount of experienced mercenaries for their campaigns. Yet more favours Venice in the form of its connection to the Crusader States in the Levant - alliances and treaties which are not only a barrier for the §YNizzarid Sultanate§!, but also ensure that the §YPapacy§! will see them as a benefactor for Christendom. \n \n Though the Venetian age of prosperity may soon be reaching its pinnacle, a fall will always seek to follow. The republic’s wars and trade conflicts have created as much hostility amongst the Mediterannean peoples as there is gold in the Doge’s private vault. The mainland Italians bear as much ill-will towards Venice for its exploiting their weakened state as the Nizzarids do for aiding the §YCrusaders§!. The mortal enemies of Venice, however, are the remnants of the §YByzantine Empire§! - an ancient realm which had been shattered two centuries prior by the dagger Venice was hiding underneath its cloak.

As one of the final three Crusader States still standing in the Near East, the Princes of the §YPoitiers§! dynasty are well aware that they are facing enemies on all sides. The rulers of Antioch have never had the greatest of reputations, often aligning with the §YSaracens§! they had sworn to repel or convert in order to gain leverage over their fellow Latins. Moreover, they have been reduced drastically in territory due to how squanderous many rulers have been. It would be fair to say that the Antiochians were reliant on the §YAngevins§! of Jerusalem and later the §YLusignans§! of Cyprus for their own survival.\n\n All that being said, Antioch is not without its saving graces. To its north lie the §YTurkish Beyliks§!, which have been atrophying under their constant wars with the fragments of the Eastern Roman Empire.

 string_start_title_cyprus: "The Kingdom of Cyprus"
 string_start_cyprus: "The Kingdom of Cyprus is an oddity among the last remaining Crusader States of the Near East. There is a certain lack of prestige surrounding the title of King of Cyprus due to how short-lived it is. The realm was established after the §YThird Crusade§!, rather than in the wake of the First like its mainland Latin neighbours of §YAntioch§! and §YJerusalem§!. To top it all off, the Kingdom of Cyprus had its roots in betrayal and bloodshed not from a Saracen, but from fellow Christians serving a renegade Byzantine governor. When the dust had settled and the corrupt Komnenid noble was deposed by a shipwrecked fleet, the Crusaders set up Cyprus as both a forward operating base and a fallback point under Jerusalem’s control, should the Levant fall to Saracen advances. \n \n Cyprus’ future was set on a course nobody could have predicted following decades of trouble with the §YLusignan§! dynasty, as King §YBaudouin the Great§! saw to stop them crawling around in the shadows and putting Jerusalem’s survival in jeopardy. Thus, the majority of the House of Lusignan was exiled to the island of Cyprus to keep them out of government affairs. When Amalric de Lusignan sailed with most of his family to Cyprus in 1202 just about everybody expected them to be tonsured, not for the local nobility to be manipulated into placing this disgraced family on the governor’s chair. When Lusignan nobles still serving in the Jerusalemite court took over the regency for the young King §YGeoffrei I§! of Jerusalem in 1291, Cyprus’ governor Henri de Lusignan saw fit to exploit the realm’s growing instability and corruption to his fullest advantage. Declaring independence as Lord of the Cypriots in 1292, Governor Henri crowned himself King of Cyprus in 1293. Despite sending many protests and threats, there was nothing Jerusalem could do. \n \n The Lusignan Kings of Cyprus are a lineage of politicians, schemers, and diplomats, so it was only natural for them to have reached out to both §YVenice§! and Antioch for protection, although even the Angevin Kings of Jerusalem were willing to cooperate after a few decades of standoffs. Perhaps they were simply relieved to have the Lusignans off their backs, though nobody truly knows. Whatever the case, the future of this small Crusader State may be secure from a number of outside threats, but it is the interior which has begun to cause problems. Much like Antioch, Cyprus’ population are primarily Orthodox Christians, who are embittered by the evermore elitist Catholic ruling class. To add further insult to injury, the native Greek population has not taken kindly to being sidelined in favour of foreigners - especially the Latins who betrayed the Emperor in Constantinople in 1204. If the King of Cyprus is to look outwards and secure a foothold in the Holy Land, he must first look within and stop the flames of revolt from being fanned. Should Cyprus fail in this, the youngest Crusader State may also be the first to fall since Tripoli..."

With their own king, §YHarald Hardrada§!, dead alongside much of his retinue, the Yngling dynasty were forced to relinquish their claim to the English throne, returning home defeated and bloodied, yet also humbled. Unfortunately, Norway's troubles only grew worse from this point, as her neighbouring Scandinavian kingdoms were eyeing up what may prove an easy conquest.\n\nAlthough Norway had remained largely at peace for some time after their defeat at English hands, it was unfortunately faced with both Danish and Swedish hostility for many decades. The Danes were still clinging onto an ephemeral hope that they could reclaim §YCnut the Great's North Sea Empire§!, having only been dissolved for several decades. Meanwhile, Sweden had been facing a constant influx of §YChristian§! refugees fleeing Danish and Norwegian persecution, and did not take kindly to the continued attacks on their own flock.\n\nBy sheer luck or the intervention of the Aesir, however, the kingdom remained in relative peace despite all of its external woes. That was, at least, until 1130, when King §YSigurd Magnusson's§! death permitted a multitude of claimants to begin tearing the kingdom apart in order to seize the throne. Due to the lack of defined succession laws, this period of constant warfare persisted for several decades, only abating when the Christian Swedes commenced a full-scale invasion of the Norse realm.\n\nIndeed, this §Y'Northern Crusade'§!, as it had been dubbed by German chroniclers, was a bloody affair, with the Swedes tearing through the land and sacking whatever they could in the name of expanding the Cross' influence to the Norse heathenry. In a stroke of luck for the beleaguered Norwegians, though, the Swedes had failed to take advantage of Divide and Conquer strategy. Rather than exploit the multitude of warlords and play them off each other, the Crusaders instead settled for killing or converting as many as they could.\n\nThis ultimately allowed the Norwegian pretender, §YMagnus Erlingsson§!, to consolidate his rule in the north and west, becoming the sole king of Norway in 1164. From there, he would defeat a number of Swedish incursions, but was on the defensive until the 1180s. His lucky break arrived in the form of word that the Danes were invading Sweden, meaning that the bulk of the Crusader force had to be diverted away from Norway. Exploiting their now-greatly decreased numbers, Magnus was able to capture the Swedish king, and force a withdrawal.\n\nIt was from this point onwards that Norway had truly stabilised itself, with the implementation of clear succession laws, and the death or surrender of most rival warlords. By the turn of the century, Norway had reached a status quo which it finds itself in to this day.

King Haakon negotiated a truce with the Scottish King Alexander III, recognizing their control over the western isles and the Isle of Mann. The Norse proceeded to take ownership of the entirety of the Gaelic coast, solidifying Norwegian rule over the north. While this was a disgraceful defeat, Alexander III faced larger threats from within his own kingdom. While his house, Dunkeld, had united the Gaelic north and Scottish south, the twin sides of his realm threatened to tear each other apart, and he spent the rest of his days in court settling disputes and managing alliances while raising his son, Alexander IV of Clan Dunkeld.\n\nMeanwhile, a revolution was taking place. Monastic reform, brought about through the influence of the Catholic Church, brought Scotland closer and closer into the European sphere of influence; thus it was referred to as the “Monk’s Revolution.” This revolution also brought with it an influx of Anglo-Saxon nobles, fleeing the anarchy, into the provinces of Lothian and the lowlands in general. They integrated comfortably with the Scots, but only increased tensions with the northern Gaelic clans, as they attempted to wrest power from their control. The situation escalated with the English Conquest of Strathclyde in the year 1321, a 5 year conflict that ended with a decisive Scottish defeat.\n\nIt is the year 1444, and Scotland stands at a crossroads. The aging Alexander V believes in a united kingdom; he believes in a land that unites the Scots, the Anglo-Saxons, the Gaelic clans, and all peoples of Albion, but he knows many are unfaithful in this dream. The battle lines are being drawn in court, country, and clans. Scotland will forever change in the coming century, and Alexander believes his heir, Edgar II, is the one to see this change through. He is a meek and timid boy, but he shall grow into the lion the kingdom needs him to become. Be it a High King of the Gaels, the Lord of the Scots, or the King of Albion, his subjects wait in anticipation with bated breaths to witness the transformation of Edgar as well as the Kingdom of Scotland, for better or for worse."

Alas, such optimism was rapidly dashed against the rocks of the Golden Horn. Despite facing a crisis which may have seen them hanged from the §YTheodosian Walls§!, the §YAngelid§! dynasty nonetheless proved themselves utterly incapable of anything short of malicious negligence and gross mismanagement of the Eastern Roman Empire. With nothing but the most opulent degeneracy on full display and never a care in the world, the House of Angelos was quickly taken advantage of by the aristocracy.\n\nHaving maintained their useless emperors as figureheads, the Constantinopolitan clique would further advance the Byzantine nosedive, filling their coffers while the people starved and fled eastwards. Even against the threat of §YBulgarian§! invasion in the 13th century, the imperial regime did nothing in response. Yet, when §YLeon Gabras§! took up arms and saved the empire, he was hastily banished to a governorship in Anatolia. With an impending §YTurkish§! invasion, it was expected that he would perish, no longer posing a threat to the machinations of the political elite. This assumption proved false, and the Saviour of Thrace declared unilateral independence from Constantinople and from the Empire, having concluded that the Roman dream was long dead.\n\nThe Imperial court was utterly livid at the secession of the Anatolian provinces, but even if they wanted to launch a war of reclamation, this was impossible; in order to skim more money off the budget, the chancellor had disbanded the Imperial Army in AD 1294. In its place, a truly unreliable mercenary force was instituted. This warband preferred plundering Byzantine lands to protecting them, however, greatly reducing imperial rule in the countryside. Left with no army of its own and a plummeting economic situation, the Byzantine Empire would then be forced to mothball its fleet, culminating in Venice seeping into the Aegean in the 1300s with the help of an Epirote rebellion under the disgruntled §YPalaiologos§! family.\n\nThe complete failure of the government in Constantinople to maintain even a shred of legitimacy and influence would end in one of the worst military blunders in Roman history. At the dawn of the 15th Century, the empire would attempt to assert its hegemony over the Bulgar Empire, despite lacking a proper military, resulting in the rapid loss of §YMacedonia§! and §YWestern Thrace§! to a miniscule §YBulgarian§! detachment.

Aspiring to be a soldier from a young age, the dukeling had demonstrated a degree of martial prowess very few possess.\n\nQuickly rising through the ranks, much to the corrupt §YAngelid§! dynasty's ire, Leon Gabras would score a string of victories against the enemies of the Empire, becoming a household name among the Byzantine subjects in the process. His greatest accomplishment was yet to come, however, for the vast armies of the §YBulgarian Empire§! would soon come pouring in from the north, overwhelming much of Thrace and Macedonia by the end of AD 1261.\n\nRallying anyone he could under the flags of the Byzantine Empire and the House of Gabras, Leon would make his stand at the ruins of Pella, where his forces would defeat and rout the Czar's army. Despite saving the realm, an act which had earnt him the epithet of Soter - Saviour - Leon Gabras was hastily exiled to a governorship in §YAnatolia§! by the Angelid court, whose jealousy and paranoia were nearing the breaking point.\n\nIn the Spring of AD 1267, when Western Anatolia found itself beset by another wave of Turkish incursions, Leon Gabras was left to fend off an overwhelming enemy force alone for a second time, scoring yet another stunning victory. When news reached the capital, the court responded by §Ycharging the Megas Strategos with High Treason against the Church and People of Rome§!, demanding that he fall on his sword, or to stand trial in Constantinople.\n\nUtterly disillusioned by this crushing betrayal, Leon Gabras became convinced that the Roman dream was long dead, having morphed into a malignant rot. A grand mutiny followed in AD 1269, when Nicaea declared unilateral independence from Constantinople, followed soon thereafter by most Greek-held territories east of the Hellespont, save for several Imperial strongholds along the coast.\n\nThe ruling military governors had been longtime friends of Leon Gabras through correspondence, thus a strong martial bond forged the core of the §YHellenic Kingdom of Nicaea§!.

Foolishly, the Greeks failed to note in their records and almanacks the anguish of the serf and the humiliation of the noble, whose resentment would only build with time, waxing as Roman power waned.\n\nTheir doom would arise by their own hand, as Boyars upon the border of Asia Minor schemed away from the nosy meddling of the court.

As one of the few surviving remnants of the Old World - the Classical Era of legends and sprawling, marble and gold empires - there have been many envious rivals to make attempts at prying Persian glory from Sasan’s lineage. Though a meagre few have come close to destroying Persia, the Sasanians almost met their match when they bore the brunt of rapid Islamic invasions out of Arabia in the 7th Century - a series of conflicts immediately following an already crippling war with the Byzantines. \n \n Yazdegerd III, King of Kings, proved ineffective in his rule as the Persian Empire built by the great Sasan crumbled. No greater echoing of this spiral into oblivion could be seen but for the capital Ctesiphon’s swift capture and sacking at the hands of the Islamic forces in 637 AD. With barely even a hastily-drafted levy as the remainder of the Persian army, Yazdegerd’s sole saving grace was his foresight in evacuating most of the treasury from the capital as his court abandoned the west. The additional funding it provided allowed for bolstered ranks and better equipment when the Persian forces decisively routed the Caliphate at the Battle of Nahavand. The Sasanian victory against the Caliphate allowed their thinned garrisons to maintain the central territories behind the Zagros, albeit at the cost of the treacherous Caspian satraps seceding upon realising their liege was incapable of retaliation. Though central Persia was consolidated, the Shahanshah’s satraps proved ineffective at preserving southern Persia - particularly the birthplace of the Achaemenid dynasty in Fars - which fell with minimal organised resistance. \n \n As the centuries passed, the Sacred Fires in the north were the only ones to remain alight; Islam had entrenched itself in much of Western and Central Asia. The westward invasions of the bloodthirsty Mongols and the Turkic Seljuks and Timurids over the years would have little effect on the isolationist Persians in the north, as the mountainous natural borders would prove to be their best defence, complementing the hit-and-run tactics of the new Sasanian army.

After several years of war by attrition, the Danes held little more than §YHull§!. The Ænglish counterattack ground to a halt, however, when word arrived that the marcher lords still present in Ireland had been toppled by Gaelic uprisings.\n\n The year is 1444, and §YHarold V§! of Wessex gazes longingly across the countryside. A king since infancy, Harold has resigned himself to half-hearted sabre-rattling in the hopes that he could someday restore Ængland to her former glory. To his luck, though, this dream may come to fruition sooner than expected, for word of unrest in Francia has been spreading like wildfire amongst the courts of Europe. Should Ængland exploit this, the golden years of Harold II’s reign may be outshone by a brighter future on the horizon. An Ænglish future."
 string_start_title_danish: "The Kingdom of Denmark"
 string_start_danish: "For many hundreds of years, the very mention of the Danes has struck fear into the hearts of Christian Europe. Tales are spread by merchants, clergymen and peasant alike of imposing warriors in their long ships; reavers and Vikings raiding the rugged coastline of Britain and sacking the wealthy cities of the Holy Roman Empire’s Frankish heartland. Of course, the Viking Age is but a distant memory to the inhabitants of Scandinavia. The fearless warriors who set out to conquer Europe have long-since assimilated into the local populations whilst aspiring heroes turn to Orthodox Christianity so they may join the prestigious Varangian Guard of Byzantium. \n \n Denmark’s age of terror has long since come to an end. So fragile is their reputation that all it would take is a single major defeat against the Christian powers of Western Europe to shatter their foreboding visage, revealing the stagnating power behind the curtain. Luck has been on Denmark’s side thus far, but it may only be a matter of time before the Viking Age ends in the minds of the commonfolk south of the Baltic once and for all. \n \n Despite the Great Heathen Army’s ultimate destruction against the Anglo-Saxons, and the disintegration of the North Sea Empire upon King Cnut the Great’s death, there have been a number of attempts - half-hearted as they may be - to reclaim this glory. Of particular note were the final raids against the English in the 1390s, during their Heptarch Wars. While Jorvik resisted Danish assault, the province of Hull ultimately fell in 1395 and was placed under the Danelaw for the first time since the Dark Ages.\n\nIn more recent years, though still banished from the realm of possibility for some time yet, a pan-Scandinavian idea has begun to entrench itself among the Danes. The year is 1444 of the Julian Calendar, and Denmark finds itself on thin ice. Can she navigate the frigid political landscape and not just establish an empire spanning the North Sea, but also unite the squabbling nobles of Sweden and Norway under a single crown? Only time will tell whether Denmark can ascend to new heights, though failure may result in its own very own Ragnarok."

Alas, the situation rapidly spun out of control, leaving his successors scrambling to secure what land they could from the rogue kingdom. It was from these annexations that the §YDuchy of Franconia§! was conceived - a vestige of the §YSalian Franks§!, under §YOttonian§! overlordship. When Francia marched against the Ottonians in §Y1014§!, the §YFranconians§! joined their distant kinsmen in scouring §YSaxony§!. The resurgent Carolingians, understanding that the §YHouse of Salian under Heinrich III§! could act as a buffer against potential Saxon revanchism, thus granted the duke kingship over Franconia to reward the Salians’ pledge of fealty.\n\nDespite initial hopes, Franconian power remained contained, stuck between two more powerful states and forced to contend with local rebellions, in addition to incursions by feudal rivals from§Y Swabia§! and the ruins of Saxony. When §YKing Heinrich VI§! was killed by rioters at §YRothenburg in 1357§!, the kingdom finally shattered. The magnates of §YLower and Upper Franconia§! dissolved their oaths of loyalty to the new king, §YFriedrich III§!, forcing him to spend the rest of his reign trying - and failing - to regain these lost lands, ending in a truly decisive Franconian defeat near §YHesse in 1371§!.

He spent the last few months of his reign in his palace, frozen in despair until his passing in early §Y1372§!, succeeded by his son. §YConrad III§! was more shrewd and patient than his father, seeing that Franconia was not the mighty kingdom it was created to be. To remedy the realm’s shortcomings, he invested heavily in the burgeoning textile trade, and developed a new variety of wine grape, §YFranconian Sweet§!, to make what some have called the §Ybest dessert wine east of the Rhine§!.\n\nNot neglecting the military either, the Franconian army’s ranks swelled with knights drawn in by tourneys and awarded estates, allowing Conrad to march north against §YHesse and Mark§! in §Y1408§!.

These §YMagyar Wars§! were savage, but culminated in §YDuke Luitpold§! routing the Magyars at the §YBattle of Pressburg in 907§!.\n\nThe further disintegration of §YCarolingian§! power in Germany led to the rise of the §YOttonians§! in the §Y920s§!. The Bavarians used this period of relative peace to develop their lands, becoming one of the most prosperous regions in all of Germany. From §Y1014 to 1024§!, Saxony was ravaged by vengeful Carolingian armies, leading to a §Yfeudal reorganisation§! across the Empire. In this shuffle, Bavaria fell under the sway of the surging §YStyrian Babenberg dynasty§!, remaining as the crown jewel of the ducal house until a §Ycoalition of Swabians and Lombard§!s, led by §YFriedrich Barbarossa§!, marched against Styria to support the §YHabsburgs’ Tyrolean Rebellion in 1049§!.\n\nAfter a series of §Ysevere defeats§! at the hands of the Barbarossa, the §YMunich-based Wittelsbach dynasty§! saw their chance to escape the §YStyrian yoke§! and rose in revolt.

To better facilitate the cultivation of trade routes and influence across the Baltic, the Hansa - with aid from the§Y Teutonic Order§! - arranged for the foundation of numerous trading colonies along the §YAmber Road§! in the late §Y12th Century§!.\n\nThe most prosperous of these became the cities of §YLubeck, Danzig, and Riga§!, which were admitted into the League and given Free City status in §Y1186§!.

Despite modest aid from the Hansa and Teutons, even receiving the §YPope’s§! blessing, a lack of aid from the §YEmperor and his Electors§! triggered the §YWendish Crusade’s collapse in 1247§!.

As §YEmperor Bernard’s§! sons geared up to fight a civil war over their fathers titles upon his death in §Y924§!, the §YOttonians§!, led by their patriarch §YOtto Liudolfinger§!, ‘the Great,’ made his move. He appealed to the German Dukes, making the case that only he could prevent the brewing Frankish war from spilling out into Germany. The Germans listened, and when they met in Aachen, they named Otto their Emperor. The Carolingians, embroiled still in civil war, could only protest.\n\nAs his first act as Emperor, Otto moved against Francia in its moment of weakness. In the mid 10th Century, Otto pried §YArles§! and §YLotharingia§! away from Paris’s grasp. Otto hoped that this would weaken Francia permanently and end Carolingian domination of the Empire. His grand designs were not to last. By the time Otto died in AD §Y973§!, Francia had already recovered by leaps and bounds, and while the Ottonian line retained the emperorship until the death of §YOtto III§!, their dynasty had already begun to decline. When the Dukes reconvened in AD §Y1014§!, the Styrians, Fraconians, and Swabians were pressured into backing the Franks, rather than Otto III’s designated heir, §YHeinrich II of Saxony§!. The new Emperor, upon learning that Heinrich and the dissident dukes protested the election, invaded Saxony soon after. The §YHarrying of the North§! was a horrible affair. The Ludolfingers were exterminated, Saxony was looted of all its worth, and her allies scattered to the wind. In place of the freshly annihilated enemy, the Franks rose the outwardly loyal §YBillungs§! to the Dukedom.\n\nHowever, the Billungs were simply better players of the Great Game than the Liudolfingers. They knew Francia would recover. They also knew that the Franks would seek vengeance on Saxony for its usurpation. By paying lip service to the Carolingians, they secured their existence as everything around them burnt. They moved quickly to pacify the chaos that had overtaken their lands, waging war against the bandits who roamed the countryside, erstwhile the rebellious counts in the West were subject to Billung suzerainty after a crushing defeat on the Elbe. With extensive reconstruction underway, Saxony was soon tamed. However, the brilliance of Otto’s reign, and the Liudolfingers’ humiliating fall, had never truly been forgotten to the Saxons. And so, for centuries, as the §YBrüderkriege§! consumed the world around them, Saxony slowly built itself up once more.\n\nIt is now AD 1444, and the regnant Duke §YHeinrich V von Billung§! is in a better position than anybody since Otto himself to achieve Saxony’s dream.

With him came an entourage of English missionaries, with whom Edgar had entrusted the rapid §YChristianisation§! of the Swedes and Geats. Already a man of the cross himself, Karl would, through his endorsement of proselytisation, earn the epithet of §Y'The Pious'§!. Throughout his reign, Karl warmly welcomed Christians fleeing from persecution in Denmark and Norway, yet while the Old Gods remained strong in some parts, they withered and died across much of Sweden at marching pace. Alas, the end of Karl's reign as the first king of a unified Sweden would be far less illustrious than its beginning.\n\nWhen Norway plunged into a succession war in the 1130s, the ageing Karl saw a chance to wage holy war against his wayward kinsmen, commencing the first phase of the §YGreat Northern Crusade§!, but his death merely a year into the campaign ensured that it fell flat, sputtering out with minimal gains.

Unfortunately, with the splendour of their victories against the §YSami§! and §YFinns§! waning, and centuries of failing to oust the Danish and Norwegian heathens waxing, the Caroleans are increasingly seen as lions led by sheep. Leadership in both the Order and the Army is bought and sold at the whimsy of nobles, most of whom have never even swung a great-axe. In response to this, veteran soldiers and the privy council seek to take action against the growing corruption. Then again, perhaps a brutal defeat on the field is what the Swedes require to get their footing once more.\n\nWith the §YHoly Roman Empire§! beginning to enter what may very well be its death throes, and the normally isolationist pagan kings setting their sights on greater borders for their crowns, the people and church of Sweden have been calling for a renewal of the Great Northern Crusade. As the old order crumbles away ever so slowly, the revitalisation of Sweden proves to be the most critical of matters rapidly piling up on the King’s lap. Should he succeed, the Kingdom of Sweden will surely shine like the Northern Lights; a beacon of Christendom in the otherwise frigid boreal wastes of Europa. However, if Sweden fails to sufficiently prepare, the Kingdom will likely fall to assailants on all sides, the Cross shattered under the feet of a great heathen army."
 string_start_sicily: "In the year of 827, the island of Sicily was invaded by the Arabs. The conquest was slow and bloody; the Byzantines put up a good fight and the local populace were hostile against the invaders. In 878 the largest city on the island, Syracuse, fell. It took till 965 that all of Sicily was conquered. The following century saw the arrival of the Normans. These men came from the far north and were originally mercenaries for hire. They first served the Byzantines who tried to reconquer the island of Sicily but defected after a failed campaign. They managed to seize some lands in mainland southern Italy after dealing with the local garrisons. \n \nMeanwhile the Emirate of Sicily fractured in opposing factions. One of these factions asked the Normans for help, they obliged seeing they could destabilize Sicily even further and perhaps seize a fortress along the coast. Hearing of this, the other factions sent a delegation to the Governor of Tunis. The delegation was able to convince the him to send an army lead by his sons. The two armies clashed at the village of Cerami. The Normans had less men but a superior army. They fought bravely but in the end had to retreat. The Mankit faction seized control and ruled Sicily from that point.\n \nIn 1328 Abu Zakirya took the throne in Tunis and founded the Hafsid dynasty. After securing his power, he sent one of his sons to Sicily as a diplomat and advisor. His son Abu Zakariya Yahya, was able to climb the ranks and in 1340 overthrow the current ruler. He consolidated his rule, made a standing army and improved the economy through reforming taxes and increasing trade with the Muslim world. When his father died in 1349, he sailed to Tunis with his army to claim the throne. After a short skirmish he was crowned Emir of Tunis and Sicily. But his ambitions wouldn’t stop there.\n \nThree years later he crossed the straits and marched to Naples. The Normans formed a coalition including the Papal States, Genoa and Florence, while Lombardy sent some mercenaries fearing for their own safety. While the coalition outnumbered him, Yahya had learned from the Normans and invested in quality. The two armies met near Amalfi. The coalition army was decimated after the leaders of the army couldn’t agree on tactics. Yahya sieged Naples and was able to take it without resistance. This increased his power but he died 2 years later.\n \nHe decided to split the Sultanate between his two sons. The Sunni son would gain Tunis while the Shiite one would gain Sicily. This Shia son, Muhammed, desired that his Sultanate be a beacon of religious and cultural tolerance, he hired people through merit, not through family or religion. Soon Sicily would be known as a land of tolerance\n \nThe year is now 1444 and Sicily looks with interest in every direction. In the north lies the heart of the infidels. Conquering it would strike a decisive blow but would unite Christendom to repel them. To the east lie the Byzantines and Bulgaria. Both hate each other and a war is brewing.

 string_start_knights: "The Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, often referred to simply as the Knights Hospitaller, is among the most affluent and highly-regarded knightly orders in Christendom to emerge from the Crusades. Initially based in Jerusalem, the Order’s successful mission to establish hospitals and care for the Faithful suffering from ailments would ultimately see the Crusader States’ sovereigns make substantial donations to expand the mission. Alongside the Knights Templar, the Hospitallers would expand to serve as armed guards for Pilgrims travelling to the Holy Land, though they never lost their reputation for going above and beyond to act with charitas and pietas to all under their care. Unfortunately, the overbearing Ayyubid Sultanate under renowned Kurdish warrior-statesman Saladin would necessitate further militarisation in an effort to save the Christian Kingdoms. Droves of Latin brethren joining the ranks of the Templars and Hospitallers ensured an astronomical growth in strength amongst the Crusader Kingdoms throughout the 13th Century, as well as a continuation of Baldwin IV’s grand strategy for Jerusalem against the Saracens.\n \nReaching their absolute peak of power in the early 14th Century, at the same time as the nascent Nizzarid Sultanate’s expansion into former Ayyubid and Abbasid-controlled lands met its conclusion, it only made sense for the Holy Orders to be outfitted for a protracted campaign. Alas, the Holy Land slipped into a period of uncertainty and economic dependency on Venice in the 1340s, erstwhile the Black Death turned the hospitals into temporary morgues. Fearing the worst was yet to come, the Hospitaller Grandmaster - with the Papacy’s oversight - made the Doge of Venice an offer he couldn’t refuse. In exchange for economic monopoly over the Order’s profits, not to mention much of their rather expansive treasury, they would receive the island of Rhodes, off the coast of Anatolia, which would henceforth become the Hospitallers’ primary headquarters.\n \nIn the preceding decades, multiple long-standing conflicts against rival naval powers stretched the Venetians too thin to garrison their non-Adriatic holdings effectively. Thus upon seeing an easy solution to their woes while also being able to save face, Venice accepted the proposal and transferred the rebellious territory to the Hospitallers, fully expecting them to be cast out to sea by the locals. Perhaps in the cruellest twist of fate for Venice since their fleet was burnt at anchor by Greek Fire in the 1200s, the Order suppressed dissent early on and had even driven up recruitment of Rhodians into the organisation. Entrenched on Rhodes for almost one hundred years come the mid-15th Century, the Hospitallers stand poised in as good a position as any to aid Christendom however they see fit. Despite the losses incurred during the calamitous Iberian Crusade of 1443, and the rather insignificant size of their forces and territory in contrast to truly sovereign entities, there is no better time than now to seize the moment!"
 string_start_title_ibeminors: "The Iberian Kingdoms"
 string_start_ibeminors: "The three kingdoms of Asturias, Navarra, and Galicia are the Iberian Peninsula’s last bastions of Christianity, having fended off the ever-growing shadow of Andalusia for generations. Despite a seemingly common cause, these rump states could not be any more different in their origins. Asturias and Galicia claim descent from the Germanic Suebi and Visigoths, who had invaded during the Roman Empire’s decline. Navarra, meanwhile, traces its people’s lineage to the ancient Vascone and Aquitanian tribes, having re-emerged following Islam’s destruction of the prior Visigothic hegemony.\n \nUpon the heathens’ initial thrust into Visigothic lands, many who had attempted to muster resistance were merely swatted aside. However, one noble by the name of Pelagius was eventually able to stage a rebellion against the newly-arrived oppressors. From the courage of himself and his allies, the Kingdom of Asturias was forged. Upon the death of Pelagius’ successor Favilla, the Crown of Asturias subsequently passed to Adelfuns, Duke of Cantabria. Adelfuns, much like Pelagius, was a man of notable success when it came to warfare. Before his own death, he had carved out a realm comprising both Galicia and Asturias, but long after Adelfun’s passing dynastic squabbles would permanently separate the two realms.\n \nNavarre’s successful bid for independence, unlike that of the Visigothic struggle, was much more of a miracle. The Basque were often finding themselves at their enemies’ swordpoints, from the Romans to the Cordobans, though Inigo Arista, Lord of Pamplona, would put a stop to that. In the 9th Century AD he successfully threw out a Carolingian invasion force before also raising the flag of rebellion against his Muslim overlords. Despite expiring briefly after this, Inigo’s actions successfully consolidated power for the Jimenez Dynasty and would result in the Kingdom of Navarre’s rise.\n \nUpon the start of the Crusades many Iberian noblemen sent their sons to the Holy Land to wage war against the Saracens in their heartland, and upon their return countless Holy Orders would be established as an honourable avenue for second children to pursue. With their proliferation came a greater bond with the Catholic church; a bond which had permitted enough strings to be pulled for the commencement of an Iberian Crusade.\n \nThis fateful expedition would not be Iberia’s saving grace, sadly. Instead, in AD 1443, the Frankish-led force would be dealt a bloody yet hard-fought defeat at the hands of the Caliph. Countless nobles from all across the Holy Roman Empire and in Iberia itself fell outside the gates of Valencia, erstwhile the lands in the north were burnt to ashes by Christian raiding parties intending to starve out the Muslim forces in pursuit. The combined threat of famine and a renewed offensive were only staved off by a hasty peace agreement between the Franks and Umayyads, yet this would ill suffice in the eyes of the Iberian crusaders. Feeling betrayed and with their faith dashed in a single campaign, the future remains uncertain."

Over the past several centuries, the vile §YSaracens§! have been steadily gaining more ground in Southern Italy. Indeed, by the mid-14th century, the Holy See was faced with increasingly larger challenges during the last major §YSicilian§! offensive. Always weary of their soft underbelly, in the 1340s the Pope had sought to form a loose coalition of Italian cities, hoping that such a patchwork alliance bore strength sufficient to beat back the threat to Rome.\n\nAlas, a lack of communication between the various Italian states, paired with their innumerable conflicts of interests, lead to repeated failure. Scapegoating Papal leadership for the coalition’s collapse, all but the Norman Kingdom of §YTrinacria§! abandoned their oaths, believing it would be more productive to resume their own wars in the north. Through Italy’s collective negligence, those brigands of Sicily carved their way across the peninsula, until now they rest at the gilded doors of the Holy See itself!\n\nThe previous Pope, §YEugenius IV§!, had attempted to strengthen ties with §YFrancia§! throughout his reign, with the call for a Crusade against the §YAndalusians§! becoming the monument to his efforts. The aging Eugenius died in December of AD 1443, from a fit of apoplexy upon receiving word of the §YIberian Crusade’s§! disastrous outcome. Despite repeated efforts to rally the north to the Vatican’s defense, the turmoil spurred on by Eugenius’ failure, and the lingering spectre of the §YWestern Schism§!, have done much to weaken the Papacy’s legitimacy and influence.\n\nIn §YCapua§!, the rump-state successor to Trinacria, has proven to be nothing but a nuisance ever since the mad duke §YRobert XI de Hauteville§! took the throne. Eugenius repeatedly tried to appease Robert’s predecessors by funding Norman arts and institutions, but to no avail. The mad duke bears little care for what came from his late father and elder brother’s reigns, and is believed to be attempting to persuade §YPerugia§! and §YUrbino§! to join his cause, and proclaim himself the King of Rome. A pirate-lord with a blackened heart, Robert the Mad will likely refuse to cooperate beyond a superficial level, preferring instead to fill his arena with captives and ruin Tyrhennian commerce.\n\nEven if domestic affairs are sorted out, however, the new Pope will have to contest with far more than just his vassals. The Sultanate of Sicily, once weak and divided due to the uncontrolled banditry in Southern Italian lands, now stands to conquer the Holy See itself and make slaves out of all Italy. The Pope actively seeks for an excuse to rule Southern Italy directly from Rome, and shall see fit to reap the riches which the great cities of the south have to offer.

 string_start_title_breton: "The Duchy of Brittany"
 string_start_breton: "Brittany is regarded by both its subjects and its neighbours as a land of multitudinous heritages. Their initial stock were Celtic Britons fleeing the chaos of the Saxon invasions, and internal conflicts between Britonic Kingdoms. This led them to settle in Armorica, displacing and integrating the native Gallo-Romans. Afterwards they would come under the influence of the Franks, whose Empire first drew them in as a tributary state, and then a vassal of Francia.\n\nContrary to such arrangements, Brittany’s Duke’s have their own notions on the role of Brittany in Western Europe; often in opposition to its neighbours. The first act of treachery was Alan II’s support of the Ottonians against the Karlings, wishing to push the center of power in the Empire from the West to the East so that Brittany may have more autonomy. The grateful Ottonians did just that, gladly separating Brittany from the Kingdom of West Francia as it had with many other Frankish duchies.\n\nThe second treason saw Conan II expand the Breton demesne. Before William the Bastard’s failed invasion of England, the Norman claimant had warned neighbouring Princes against invading in his absence; William's mission bore the papal banner and was sanctified by Rome. Conan nevertheless informed William he was in fact going to take the opportunity to invade Normandy, claiming Avranchin and Cotentin as historical parts of the Duchy of Brittany, and thus his rightful lands.\n\nA force of knights marched east, pushing past the Breton March of Pouance and onto Rouen. Whilst on the warpath Conan’s squire would conspicuously perish around one of Conan’s suits of armor. Poisoned by a pair of gloves intended for Conan, this was likely an assassination attempt by William. Cautiously, albeit more determined, the Breton duke laid siege to the capital of Normandy, forcing the newly-crowned Robert of Normandy to surrender more than half of his territory.\n\nThis triumph would create a golden age for the Duchy; the wealth and power secured by victory propelling them to heights unseen. During this period many great castles and cathedrals were constructed, and piles of money were made trading with a grateful England, its incidental ally. Under the reign of Conan II, the Breton court was patron to many great men, including bards who sang folk tales in the Breton tongue. The Celtic language gained prestige in its association with the victorious Bretons, and slowed the encroachment of Frankish linguistic dominance in Brittany.\n\nCoinciding with the end of Conan’s 50-year reign was a Frankish plot to subdue England, predicated on reviving the Norman claims to the English throne. To that end, Francia coerced the Bretons to cede their Norman lands or risk war. Never the type to submit completely, the Breton’s became inspired by a centuries-old set of Ottonian Privileges.  Granted to them by Otto I himself, and known as the Privligium Britancullum, this theoretically grants them much of France. It is up to the cunning duke to decide how this document is put to use..."

When the Frankish empire was at its height, an uncontested juggernaut in Europe, these lands formed a rich and fertile core that helped uphold the power and wealth of the Franks. Yet such a massive empire could be undone by one impotent ruler, or the deep machinations of its web of politics. Such was the case when Emperor Bernard I, the bastard son of Charles the Fat, died in 924. His sons tore his realm asunder, and the Carolingian banner burned in the flames of war. The very next year, Otto Liudolfinger of the Saxons was chosen as the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nThe German Emperor marched against the remnants, shattering the Carolingians. The Nibelungs, a cadet branch of the Carolingians, were crowned in Lotharingia by Otto. Their incompetent rule, however, led to rising discontent within the Low Countries. It was the Frisians who broke off first in 988, with harsh demands from feudal lords resulting in a large-scale peasant rebellion. This cascaded further, as both Dutch and Frisian peasants refused to be forced into levy against their neighbours for their overlords in Lorraine, nor pay any more extravagant taxes. Twelve years later, in the passing of the millennium, nearly all of the Low Countries had broken free from Lotharingia, the Nibelungs too busy with internal strife and discordant politics to react.\n\nWhat resulted was a patchwork of counts and dukes, with only the Frisians rejecting the power of feudalism. This freedom was hard fought, however, as on two separate occasions, in 1011 and again in 1035, two Dukes of Holland attempted - and failed - to subjugate the Frisians, ending in the deaths of both. Aside from their own conflicts, the Low Countries were spared from the bloody trail the Carolingians carved when they made their resurgence a mere century after Otto's ascendance, burning Saxony to the ground from 1014-1024.\n\nWhile the Empire clashed with the Slavic pagans, the Dutch developed their maritime and commercial affairs and traded their luxury goods. While the Albigensian Crusade ravaged southern Francia, the Frisians, whose independence was recognized by the Carolingians, merely tended to their own business, unbothered by war. When the Hussites of Bohemia clashed with the Empire and the Papacy, the Flemish sent naught a man to any cause, instead developing their own industries of cloth and glasswork, establishing cities more urbanised than any other Europe had seen since the fall of Rome.\n\nBut can such peace last forever? The English port of Calen threatens trade in the Channel, and the Lotharingians, long since having replaced the foolish Nibelung with the clever and rich Hohenstaufens, are preparing to sink their fangs into the Frankish corpse pulled along by its decrepit Emperor. Who is to say they won't turn and reclaim their lands once again? Echoes of ambitious rulers ring out in their chambers and courts.

While many of the people of the steppe were integrated into the new Mongol Empire, remnants of the Tangut court fled, establishing the Li dynasty along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, around the settlement of Jianqiang. While the Yuan expanded their control to the southern Song, the Li expanded outward into the surrounding territory, stretching their fledgling state to the banks of the Yarlung River, and further into Tibet. \n \nWhile the court remains predominately Tangut, the subjects they ruled over varied from native Han and Tibetan and created internal strife. Sinicization was a practice often adopted and implemented, echoing the work of former Xia emperors, which created a backlash. In 1254, the state submitted to the Yuan dynasty, accepting their role as a vassal to the new Emperor Kublai Khan, in order to avoid extermination once again. Under his rule, the country was even more influenced by Confucian and Mongol culture, and the Tangut Court faced an identity crisis. In 1275, court infighting over the role of Confucianism and Buddhism led to the Li Xiao, the at the time emperor, to be assassinated and removed by his nephew, Li Bo.

For the next few decades, the tribes of Oirat remained isolated and divided until opportunity arose.  During the §YToluid Civil War§! of 1260, the four tribes of Choros, Torghut, Dorbet, and Khoid united under one banner, tossing their support to Ariq Boke against the great Kublai Khan. They entered the conflict with hopes of taking vast amounts of riches and gaining enormous prestige from the conflict, so much so that the Oirat would once more be a major player in Steppe politics.\n \nHowever, their dreams were quickly dashed. The war ended with §YKublai§! standing the victor, and the Four Oirat were dissolved by the end of it.

However, in more ways than one their defeat and subjugation was a blessing. In an attempt to homogenise his domain, Chagatai ultimately favored a Khitan court culture with Mongol oversight.

He would re-establish the Wanggiyan's authority, and style himself with his Jurchen name, §YHudun§!.\n\nThough the Jin rump state of Wanggiyan was able to thrive initially, two centuries have passed, and the world has moved on. Yuan still deters the Jin from regaining their full strength, even in its death throes. Additionally, the attitude of the Jin towards the Mongols has only worsened over the past century, with the §YTemugids§! extracting taxes and spreading its missionaries far and wide. It has, however, been in a state of sharp decline and constant freefall since the §YRed Turban Rebellion§!; they are mere paper princes, with few means to enforce order.\n\nAlthough it would be easy to strike the Mongol oppressors and drive them out of Manchuria, none of the clans are in an ideal position to accomplish this. The Wanggiyan had previously split into the Jin-proper and a cadet branch known as the §YAisin Gioro§!, leading to a fragmented realm and great concern. Aisin Gioro still bows to their overlords, but rumors of rebellion linger. It will be up to these two branches to decide who reasserts Jin authority. To the north are the overlooked §YNara Ula§!, ruling along the Hulan River. They have also been able to shake off the Temugids, holding much disdain towards the Mongols, but are also wary around their Wanggiyan rivals.\n\nBeyond civilisation lie the Wild Jurchens, whose Khans gaze enviously upon riches in southern Manchuria, dreaming of glorious conquest. Further abroad, still, are the §YEvenks§! and §YBuryats§! of the Amur and Siberia. While even the Wild Jurchens think of them as barbarians, the Evenks of Solon and Nivkh share ties to them, and the dream of unification isn’t mere fantasy.\n\nIt is AD 1444, and tensions are flaring up across Asia while Yuan's §YEmperor Shaozong§! lays on his deathbed, having refused to name a successor. It remains to be seen who will come out on top in open war, but Manchuria's clans may yet unite, and ride into legend."

 string_start_tocharia: "Deep within the Taklamakan’s vast sea of dunes, ancient kingdoms have dominated the Tarim Basin from heavily fortified oasis cities since time immemorial. The Tocharian civilisation, as it is known, is among the most isolated of its kind, among the last Indo-European holdouts in Asia. Becoming the §YXiongnu’s§! stomping ground in the 1st Century BC, the Tarim oasis-states would be subject to brutal treatment at the hands of China’s §YHan Dynasty§!. Up until the Second Century AD, many of the Tarim Basin’s eastern settlements were sacked, their populations exterminated for sport.\n\nThe Tocharians in the north and west received at least some reprieve a century prior, however, when the §YKushan Empire§! introduced Buddhism and Sanskrit to the region. Under the watchful reigns of §YKujula Kadphises§! and his successors, the Tocharians entered a golden age, having driven the Han and Xiongnu out of the oases. Alas, the Kushans fell in the 6th Century AD, scattering its subjects to the wind, and allowing for the vultures to descend once more. The §YHepthalites§! overran the Tocharian kingdoms of Kuci and Shule, before being shattered themselves, by the Gokturk Khaganate in the 560s.\n\nDespite seizing Turfan and Agni, two of the northern kingdoms, Kroraina and Kuci stood fast, aided by the Kushan dynasty’s rump state in Shule. The Turks were subjected to a bloody guerrilla campaign, the Khagan’s horde atrophying into a withered husk. Come the 7th Century AD, China’s §YTang Dynasty§! would assail the Tarim Basin. The Tang had demanded fealty from the Tocharians, though Kroraina, Shule and Kuci, remained obstinately defiant, recalling their prior treatment at the hands of the Chinese.\n\nThe ensuing war ravaged much of the Basin, though at long last, the Western Protectorate was felled. The war ultimately ended in the Tocharians ransoming Chinese officers, and executing enough Tang troops to match the number of slain Tocharian civilians. From the 8th to 10th Centuries, the Tocharians then bludgeoned the §YTibetan Empire§! beyond the mountains, before facing a §YUyghur§! invasion. Having been better-prepared, the Tocharians were victorious by the 12th Century. Little did they know of the storm which would follow, of §YGenghis Khan§! and his Mongol horde at the Silk Road’s doorstep.\n\nWhen tribute dried up in 1219, the Great Khan razed Kuci, the most affluent of the oasis states. The male population was butchered, while the women and children were enslaved. The remaining kingdoms immediately presented mountains of gold and oaths of loyalty, while the fragmented remnants of Kuci would resettle within cave cities, never fully recovering.\n\nMongol rule in the Tarim was short-lived, persisting for a mere century before the §YChagatai Khan’s§! authority over Central Asia collapsed; crushed under the weight of rebellion and Yuan’s spiteful neglect. Come AD 1444, the Great Yuan on the verge of collapse themselves; the Tocharians now vie for control of the Tarim. War is on the horizon."

 string_start_yuan: "The Yuan once stood as the pinnacle of the imperial dynasties, having ruled a sprawling empire which spanned the Orient, and collecting tribute from isolated Japan to the distant Rus’. Alas, Yuan’s brief stay at the summit of power was short-lived. Simmering religious and ethnic tensions between Mongolic and Chinese subjects, worsened by the Borjigins styling themselves as both Mongol Khagan and Chinese Emperor, came to a boil within the reign of §YKublai Khan§! himself.\n\nIn the year 1287, Kublai fell in battle when confronting Mongol traditionalist rebels, led by the Nestorian Prince §YNayan Temugid§!, who had opposed the Yuan’s sinophilic and anti-Christian policies. Although the rebellion failed to dislodge Kublai’s line, it nonetheless preserved Nestorianism within China, and secured greater power for the Mongol and Jurchen clans.\n\nThe tensions within Yuan, amplified by Nayan, further worsened due to an innumerable number of succession crises, topped off by the endemic Black Death, and severe famines. The most decisive blow to this ailing state, however, would come with the 1351 §YRed Turban Rebellion§!. Stemming from rioting labourers along the Yangtze River, mishandling saw it become a full-blown revolt against Mongol rule.\n\n§YToghon Temur§!, then-emperor, had entrusted his prime minster §YToqtoqa§! to put down the rebellion. However, Toqtoqa was hastily recalled out of fear for his rising influence within the court. Without a strong and capable officer to command Yuan’s forces, the rebellions spiraled out of control, angering Toghon’s half-Korean son Prince Ayushidara. With Toqtoqa’s aid, Ayushidara, now §YBiligtu Khan§!, forced Toghon into exile.\n\nBiligtu, aware that Mongol authority had collapsed outside of northern China, made moves to consolidate his regime and adopted the title §YEmperor Zhaozong§!, though he ultimately died in 1380. Biligtu’s son Maidarbal, crowned as Emperor Jingzong was usurped within a year by his uncle Khutula, who styled himself §YEmperor Dezu§!, and was exiled to Goryeo. By the 1390s, though, Dezu was on his deathbed and Goryeo faced collapse amidst the Joseon rebellion. The dying Dezu was able to reconcile with his nephew, naming him heir, provided that Maidarbal would be succeeded by his cousin, Prince Sorqaqder.\n\nJingzong’s second reign saw steppe tensions rise, with many clans rejecting the Yuan administration due to Temugid agitation. Jingzong stayed his already-cautious hand, concerned that another war could leave the Yuan weakened. Maintained the peace until his death in 1414, the throne passed to Sorqaqder, now styled as §YEmperor Shaozong§!.\n\nThe year is AD 1444, and with an uneventful reign marked by thirty-four years of peace and stagnation, Shaozong is at long last on his deathbed. Stubbornly, however, the ailing emperor still refuses to address the issue of succession. As the last pillar of peace and stability within Yuan, Shaozong’s passing will surely prove disastrous, with old wounds reopening as if they were inflicted only yesterday..."

 string_start_toyouji: "The Japanese Archipelago has long been in the Mongol Empire’s periphery, but was once independent of the steppe lords. Several centuries prior to the invasion, Japan sat under the influence of the Hojo Clan’s §YKamakura Shogunate§!. Their rule, however, came to an end when the Shogun foolishly refused to pay tribute to the Mongols. When the §YKhagan’s great invasion force§! landed in Kyushu, they were met with fierce fighting which persisted even after a beachhead was secured. The Mongols’ capture of a safe landing ground for reinforcements, however, spelt the Shogunate’s doom. With a sizeable influx of fresh troops disembarking, the invaders were able to make headway into Kyushu, having overwhelmed local resistance.\n\nIn the perfect position to maintain a brief offensive against the Shogunate, the Mongols would divide their armies into two groups; one force would overrun Shikoku, subduing the island, whilst another would march through Western Honshu. While the Shikoku Group managed to accomplish their objectives with few complications, the Honshu army was not so lucky. Facing constant harassment and severe attrition the whole time, they were forced to make a desperate rush for Kyoto, seizing the capital and the young §YEmperor Go-Uda§! before a relief force could arrive.\n\nWith the emperor as a hostage and unwilling to further stretch supply lines, the Yuan had the Shogun dragged before the negotiating table to make a number of concessions. Although permitted to retain their own Emperor, the Japanese were ultimately §Yforced to accept the Yuan as their overlords§!, losing a significant degree of their sovereignty in the hasty peace. With the Hojo Clan were stripped of their authority, §YPrince Toghon§!, a son of Kublai, ascended as Shogun.\n\nIncensed at snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, the now-former Shoguns would neither forget nor forgive. Kyushu, Shikoku, and most of Kansai fell under the rule of various Yuan officers from Mongol, Chinese, and Korean lineages. Western Japan beyond the Kansai region was not conquered by the Mongols, having recognised Prince Toghon as Shogun, thus being spared a brutal reprisal. These foreigner clans would gradually assimilate into Japanese culture and society, with Prince Toghon’s line in particular founding §YHouse Toyouji§!.\n\nJapan under Mongol rule was burdened with a growing neglect, as Yuan often found itself embroiled in crises and succession disputes. Eventually, the §YRed Turban Rebellion§! would cause the collapse of Mongol authority across much of the Empire, with numerous Japanese clans turning on the Toyouji, splitting them between their holdings in Kyoto and Kyushu. The Kamakura Hojo emerged once more as the strongest clan of the West, aiming to one day restore their rule. Despite the initial upheaval, decades have passed with little change, but such a situation cannot last forever. Both the Shogun and his foes seek to break the stalemate, and with Yuan in its death throes, this is a chance they will not have to wait much longer for."
 string_start_title_sakya: "The Kingdom of Sakya"
 string_start_sakya: "At the peak of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, Tibet had been under the administration of the Sakyapa sect, based in the Sakya Monestary. While subordinate to the emperor in Beijing, the Sakya government was given some autonomy and control over the eastern Kham regions, with regional administrations in Lingtsang and Gonjo serving directly under the Sakya. The Xuanzheng Yuan, or the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs, was created during this time. Run by Tibetan Buddhists, it was the dominating organization by which not only the Sakya answered to, but also the various monasteries and missions that the other sects of Buddhism followed. However, all was not as it seemed. While many would assume that Tibet was a unified entity, it was rife with internal and regional strife. In the mid-14th Century, with the receding Yuan, the Sakya faced rebellion from the growing power of the Phagmodrupa dynasty.\n\nThe Phagmodrupa dynasty, led by the charismatic Changchub Gyaltsen, launched several revolts against the Sakya, hoping to control the various myiarchies within Tibet. The ruler of the Sakya at the time, the young and unassuming Lotro Gyaltsen, was called upon to support his territory against the new challenger to Sakya rule. With aid from the surviving Yuan, the Phagmodrupa dynasty was halted before they could continue their offensive into the Sakya territory. With this, the regional kingdoms in Kham became independent, with Lingstang and Gonjo becoming the new dominant powers in the region, along with a resurgent Tangut state in Li pushing into the south of Kham. In short, the Sakya dominion had collapsed around all but the territory surrounding their home monastery. In the ensuing years, the Phagmodrupa would collapse from regional infighting, with the new Rinpungdra dynasty breaking free and controlling the northern Tsang territories around Lhasa, leaving the older state in U. While the Sakya state attempted to capitalize on this weakness, the state simply had too few soldiers and support to properly attack into their weakened neighbors; the Mongol Yuan were far too focused on their own rebellions to intervene in Tibet, aside from continuing to support the Mongol controlled Amdo.\n\nThe Year is 1444 and Sakya remains in a three-way deadlock between Tsang and U. Each side must act with the utmost of caution and care; one wrong step and their kingdom could collapse. The current Sakya Trizin remains within the complex walls, content with controlling and defending their own territory over expanding to their rivals. If Sakya wishes to survive the coming century, they must find a way to establish dominance once more over their neighbors and restore their control over Tibet."
 string_start_title_centraltibet: "The Central Tibet"
 string_start_centraltibet: "In the Mid-14th Century, the ruler Changchub Gyaltsen rose up to fight against the dwindling power of the Sakya dynasty. With him, he had the support of his own Phagmodrupa dynasty. The family did not wish to wage war against the Yuan, as even in their weakened state the Yuan’s forces were quite formidable. Instead, a short, concentrated coup within the heart of Tibet allowed them to take control of Lhasa and effectively dethrone the Sakya. However, a Khalkha Force of 10,000 Horsemen came to aid the Sakya at the last minute, breaking away from the Yuan. From here, the Phagmodrupa forces were halted, and could not push further into the heart of the Sakya monastery. From here, the Phagmodrupa established their own kingdom in the heart of Lhasa.\n\nHowever, not all would be well. The Sakya would routinely put pressure on the Phagmodrupa state, battling it out for control of the various families in central Tibet. More so than that, the Li, Ling, and Gonjo all exerted control over the Kham region, creating an uneasy situation politically. This was undercut by internal divisions; regionalism and local families constantly vying for power and dominance within the Kingdom. One such dynasty, the Rinpungdra family, began to gain considerable power at the start of the 15th Century. The two families both primarily backed different sects of Tibetan Buddhism, with Phagmodrupa supporting Gelug schools while Rinpungdra supported the Karmapa sect. In 1430, the Rinpungdra family rallied support and attacked the Phagmodrupa dynasty, taking over Lhasa and the northern Tsang area. This forced the Phagmodrupa into the southern U region, still holding strong.\n\nThe Year is 1444, and the two states of U and Tsang remain in a deadlock with one another. With the ever-present threat of the Sakya dynasty in the west and the Kham dynasties to the east, this position is not the most favorable for either state. However, should they manage to come out on top, one could dominate and control the region completely, reforging the classical Tibetan Empire."
 string_start_title_kham: "The Kingdom of Kham"
 string_start_kham: "When the Mongols established the three major administrative districts in Tibet, the Kham region was perhaps the most disunified. Under the control of various local myiarchies and monasteries, the region lacked much of centralized authority. Instead, power spread outward from monasteries and cities of major importance into the countryside. Here, two monasteries stand out above the rest, that being Lingtsang and Gongjo. Devout followers of the Sakya path, these two city states were key in controlling the region, and their loyalty to the Yuan Empire was oft rewarded. Gongjo would be given governorship over Kham for a time in the 13th century at the behest of Kublai Khan, while the Lingtsang family aided the new Mongol rulers of Amdo. As the Mongol Empire fell back behind the Yellow River, the Sakya’s authority over Tibet began to fade. When the Phagmodrupa rose up against the Sakya, Lingtsang and Gongjo became independent functionally, keeping out of the central Tibetan civil wars.\n\nThis period that followed was one growth, yet also of challenge. The two rival polities expanded their powers outwards, often clashing with one another in spiritually and in the realms of politics. Various monasteries found themselves supporting one side or another, which lead to the rapid growth of the two families. With their placement atop vital silk road trade routes, both the Yuan and the various Chinese states made peace with the Gongjo and Lingtsang, granting them titles and wealth for the ability to traverse through their territory safely. However, rival groups began to rise up to challenge these dueling forces. The Li dynasty, a remnant of the old Tangut Xi Xia state, pushed into the southern Kham territories, expanding their influence over the region. Meanwhile, the Amdo state, run by a descendant of Godan Khan, began to expand their own military prowess into the northern regions as well. The Kham Region is more tense than ever, and with these two rising powers, it is unclear as to whether or not Kham shall be dominated by new or old powers.\n\nThe Year is 1444. The Gyelpos of Gongjo and Lingtsang eye each other’s states with fear and envy. Neither is willing to make the first move, but they paradoxically must move quickly. If they delay, Amdo or Li could move in and dominate them quickly. And if not them, then perhaps should the feuding lords of Central Tibet work together, they could move to re-establish their claims on this territory. Either way, these monasteries must prepare themselves for the coming century, as there will be change, strife, and glory to be had in this new age."

 string_start_amdo: "The Amdo region of Northern Tibet is one of shifting empires and powers. With the fall of the Tibetan Empire in the 10th Century, the following period of fragmentation saw the rise of the Tsongkha theocracy, a powerful polity that kept close relations with the Song Dynasty. However, they too would collapse, to the emerging Tangut empire, which became the Western Xia. While this empire stretched across the north of Amdo and the Tsongkha region, it was subsequently destroyed after a brief two century rule, and the Tangut people sent fleeing south in 1236 with the invasion of the Mongol Empire. At this point, the Amdo region was brought under the control of the son of Ogedai, Godan Khan, who established the Amdo state as his own personal realm. He then would lead an army into Tibet, conquering the fractured kingdoms with several thousand Mongol soldiers, and establishing the Sakya rule over the kingdom.\n\nAmdo, during this period, saw a revival of culture and architecture brought on by Mongol patronage. The descendants of Godan were often in a Cho-Yon with the Lamas of the region; the Lamas would bestow titles to the kings, thus giving them legitimacy, while the Kings would provide protection and security to the Lamas. This relationship saw the Mongol empire funding the building of several monasteries across the Amdo region. While the locals were often subject to unfair tax laws that saw much of their wealth leaving to the metropole of Khanbaliq, there was an explosion of art, literature, and buildings unlike anywhere else in Tibet, for a period.\n\nHowever, as the Mongol empire began to recede behind the yellow river, Amdo became increasingly independent from their overlords. The territory of this clan increasingly shrunk to the Amdo region, due to the Yuan administration integrating more and more of the Gansu region. They wished to uphold the Sakya administration in Central Tibet, sending troops to aid the war against U-tsang in the mid-14th Century, but they were not enough. The Mongol dominance over Tibet collapsed shortly after, with Kham, Ngari, and Lhasa slipping out of Mongol hands. The Amdo at this time began to shift their strategy; if the Sakya could not control Tibet, they must be usurped. Thus began their expansion into northern Kham, coming up against fierce resistance from the states of Gongjo and Lingtsang.\n\nThe Year is 1444. Amdo is ruled by the Borjigin Clan, and the descendants of Godan. With the Yuan continuing to struggle for survival, and Tibet being decentralised and broken, the Amdo set their eyes on the territory, hoping to restore their former domain to a new era of Mongol Rule."

However, its position in the Tibetan empire has always been contested. It remained fragmented and broken until the 13th Century, with the power emanating from Ngari slowly being overtaken by that of Purang and Yatse. Foreign invasions from Ladakh and Kara-Khanid maintained this period of darkness, as fewer and fewer monastic temples were built, and no significant power was able to rise in these conditions. However, by 1250, the Kingdom of Guge became united once more under the command of Krhadhicalla. He pushed through and united the provinces of Purang and Yatse as well; however, with his death, the kingdom was absorbed into the Sakya Administration of the Mongols. During this period, Purang and Yatse grew closer once more and re-asserted their dominance over Ngari again, however by the 1370s, the Guge Kingdom pacified Purang and Yatse, dissolving Purang as a polity.\n\nThe following century was something of a golden age for the Guge Kingdom. The fall of the Sakya regime allowed Guge to once more return to prominence as an independent polity. The kingdom became integrated with the Indus River trade, and the wealth received from this venture granted them the ability to rejuvenate the Kingdom. All long the river and the mountains, the lords build large monastical sites with classical Tibetan architecture. While the other states such as Sakya and Kham were locked in combat with one another, the Guge Kingdom continued to grow its wealth and power. Religious reforms of the Gelukpa school in 1420 oversaw a drastic change in the Kingdom’s religious system, leading to it becoming the dominant school in Guge. To say that there were no problems would be untrue; Tocharian raiders from the north continue to plague the kingdom, and the Shule’s conversion to Nestorian have sent waves of missionaries to our kingdom. However, this only infused a new aspect into the state’s cultural golden age, with Murals depicted Nestor and Christ appearing on monastery walls and in new great halls.\n\nThe Year is 1444. Namkha Wangpo, the current ruler of Guge, oversees an age of prosperity and peace within his kingdom. With the current state of Tibet, he looks out at the great plateau with dreams of conquest and glory. Yet, he must remain cautious. Those living in a golden age are often blinded by the brilliance of their works, cannot see its end rapidly approaching.

In a feeble attempt to quell the chaos, Yuan had allowed for local forces to be raised by military leaders, but as more and more authority broke down, these warlords became less reliable. The warlords, and the rebels Yuan hoped they could destroy, would eventually divide China south of the Yellow River into six states: Han, Song, Zhou, Dali, Chu, and Min.\n\nThe warlords just south of the Yellow River were Song, Han, and Zhou. Song was founded by §YZhao Wanpu§!, a son of §YEmperor Gong§! of Song, having conquered feuding warlords of the west after escaping his Tibetan exile.

Assuming command of the Turkic forces, the §YSeljuks§! spearheaded the Mihranid invasion of the Near East. However, the Seljuks were not battling for a foreign king lazing about in the Persian heartland; they had their own dreams of conquest and glory. While the Mihranid dynasty struggled for power amidst a civil war, the Seljuks continued their great campaign in the west. In the aftermath of the §YBattle of Manzikert§!, the Seljuks seized much of Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and the Caucasus, proclaiming their own empire and turning the tables against the Sassanids.\n\nThe Seljuks threw off their Iranian masters and declared a new empire in the west, subjugating the Mihranids and attempting to Turkify the entire region. While the Seljuk Empire was mighty, it was internally divided upon religious, cultural, and tribal lines. Since the Seljuks had no official state religion other than their shamanistic steppe faith, they were pulled in different directions. Some turned to §YOrthodox§! §YChristianity§!, some to the Sunni faith, and others to the traditions of the Persian elite. Even bringing in Turkic tribes to settle the Caucasus did not prevent the fledgling state's fracturing. By the time the §YMongol Empire§! pushed through Iran and Armenia in the 13th Century, the Seljuk state was already on the verge of collapse; and so, it did. Most of their lands were rent asunder and divided amongst numerous beyliks, with the Seljuk rump state of Anatolia relying upon the §YAyyubids§! for support against the mighty §YIlkhanate§!.

These §YBeyliks§!, as they were known to be called, became dominant in expanding the frontiers of the empire and establishing Turkish communities. However, as the Empire grew larger, soon the Beyliks were faced with a difficult proposition. The Seljuks were doomed to collapse, as their state had grown weak and their army was fracturing. As such, when the state came under attack by the §YMongols§!, many lords chose instead to submit to the invaders or break away and form their own states.\n \nThe breakup of the Seljuk empire began in the late 13th Century, and over this time, several major Beyliks began to organize themselves; the §YAnushtenigids§!, the §YArtuqids§!, the §YChepnids§!, the §YZangid State§!, and the §YIsfendiyarids§!. These states were found in the west of Anatolia, as there they faced limited threat from the §YIlkhanate§!. The Anushtenigids and Artuqids were among the first to convert to §YChristianity§!, claiming both sincere conversion and a political desire to create closer ties with the Byzantines. The Zangids were a republic controlled by a single family, and their conversion to Orthodoxy followed shortly after. The Chepnids, however, much like the remnant Seljuk state, converted to Sunni Islam, believing that appeasing the Seljuks and the §YAyyubids§! would prevent their destruction. The Beyliks underneath the Ilkhanate faced challenges to survive in that tumultuous state, with some finding power and others being wiped off the face of the map.\n\nOne such group, the §YSarukhanids§!, decided to play to the remaining Persian nobility, and took up the practices of §YZoroastrianism§!.

Alas, as the decades and centuries pushed on, a profound weakening amongst the kingdom's Crusader allies threw Cilicia into deep political isolation. Over time, the Cilician state empowered the §YArmenian Apostolic Church§!, transferring the religious centre to within the kingdom, and embracing a small Armenian renaissance of culture as their northern counterparts fell to the §YSeljuk Turks§!.\n\nWith their independent institutions and a state of flux within the Levant, the Cilician kingdom had to look outwards for allies. In the east lay the Seljuk threat, whereas to the west stood the §YByzantines§!. More importantly, to the south where once the §YAyyubids§! had ruled, the newly-forged §YNizzarid Sultanate§! came to dominate much of the Fertile Crescent.\n\nThis forced the Hathumid King §YLevon IV§! to seek guarantees from the remaining §YLatin§! powers, and their benefactors across the sea in Italy. With his second marriage to a §YHauteville§! princess, Levon IV gained an heir to the throne, and thawed the Cilician Kingdom out of its isolation. Regrettably, this alliance would falter a mere generation after his death, as the §YKingdom of Trinacria§! was invaded in AD 1353 by the Moorish heathens of Sicily.\n\nThe Hathumid kings came and went at breakneck pace after the loss of their Norman allies, inevitably hurling their nation into the chaos which haunts the region. The last of their line, §YOshin the Crooked§!, third of his name, was corrupt and despised both by the people and his estates. His rule was marked by a 30 year-long spree of embezzling state funds and indulging in a lavish lifestyle, up until an obscure noble named §YDavros Assarian§! and a clique of army officers enacted a palace coup.\n\nDavros would later be crowned king in §YAD 1397§!, in the process founding the regnant §YAssarian§! dynasty. He would spend his years drastically reforming the Cilician military, economy, and courts; the nation was restructured from the ground up, coming to be known by his people as Davros the Just. Although written off as a failed state under Oshin III, Davors I left it as the Pearl of the East. §YDavros II§!, the grandson of Davros the Just, would unfortunately repeal many reforms that his grandfather passed, yet again placing Cilicia in a precarious position.\n\nDavros II, oblivious to the treasonous plotting of his courtiers and subjects, has ultimately undone everything his predecessors had accomplished. Much to the displeasure of all who live under his unfortunate reign, Cilicia is on the brink of collapse yet again. Despite the dire situation, many have begun praying for Davros the Fool's reign to be cut short, so that his more promising heir can take up the mantle of leadership. Lesser Armenia's fate hangs in the balance."

 string_start_georgia: "It is the year 1444, and the Kingdom of Georgia sits loftily as the hegemon of the Caucasus, in large part thanks to the successes of its last king, §YAlexander I§!. However, their position is far from uncontested, and Georgia will need another capable leader to secure their position and lay the groundwork for a resurgent Georgian empire.\n\nPrior to the §YMongol§! invasions, Georgia’s queen §YTamar the Great§! would put her kingdom on the map by expanding its influence from the steppe in the north all the way to §YTrebizond§! in the west, holding sway over most of the Caucasus. However, shortly after her death, Georgia’s fortunes would sour as the Mongol hordes swept over the steppe. They rapidly tore through Caucasia, sacking monasteries and slaughtering villages wherever they went on their quest to conquer the known world. Many thought Georgia’s short-lived days in the sun were behind it, and it only  existed as a vassal of the Ilkhanate for many decades.\n\nGeorgia’s fortunes began to turn, however,  with the coronation of the late king, §YAlexander “the Great” Bagrationi§!. Under his skilled leadership, Georgia would transform itself into a bulwark against the tidal wave of Mongol aggression; Alexander used the chaos of the Great Mongol State's infighting to reassert Georgian independence, by expertly playing off the §YGolden Horde§! and §YIlkhanate§! off against one another. His most adept use of this strategy was when he took advantage of a dispute between the Ilkhan and the Khan of Golden Horde to not just gain land, but to humiliate the Ilkhan, contributing to their already-mounting legitimacy problems.\n\nWhile he would eventually become a monk in his old age, Alexander’s legacy left Georgia in a comfortable position as a fiercely independent and strong kingdom that controlled most of the Caucusus. However, Alexander’s eldest son §YVakhtang§! is now in control of the kingdom, and it is clear he is not currently the ruler his father was. The Ilkhanate, while greatly diminished, still poses a threat to Georgian hegemony if it plays its cards right. To the west, the §YSeljuks§! have been steadily gaining power, and could readily turn their attention away from the rapidly imploding §YByzantines§!.\n\nBut, perhaps the greatest threat of all as it currently stands is the Golden Horde. While dealing with their own share of problems, the Khan could easily still mount an expedition to end Georgian independence, assuming they could find a worthy sovereign to keep the tribes of the steppe under his control. The young Vakhtang will have to confront all these challenges and more if he is to maintain all that his father sought to achieve; Georgian hegemony in the Caucasus and beyond."

 string_start_caucasia: "The year is 1444, and the current undisputed hegemon of the region is western branch of the old §YMongol Empire§!, known as the §YGolden Horde§!, composed mostly of Tatar and Mongol families. However, as their power wanes and internal conflicts are reaching their boiling point, their tributaries eye the prosperous and vulnerable lands of steppe with greedy eyes, namely §YTheodoro§!, §YAlania§!, and §YCumania§!.\n\nThough never under the Tatar Yoke, the §YCrimean Goths of Theodoro§! have nonetheless remained under the §YGreek§! thumb for well over a century. Under the direct rule of the §YMegas Komnenoi§!, who had taken flight from Constantinople on the eve of the §YAngelid§! coup in the 12th century AD, the Gothic Principality became an influential and prosperous trading hub on the Black Sea. With the Metropole of §YMangup§! extending its influence across Crimea, separatist sentiment towards Sarai have been simmering in northern Crimea for decades. The Theodorans could take advantage of the situation, should it unravel, and secure themselves hegemony over the region for the first time since the Scourge of God broke Rome's back. If they succeed, the world may bear witness to yet another Gothic Invasion. If they fail, both the Komnenid cause - and the plight of the Greuthungi Goths - will be forever swept out into the bottomless seas of history.\n\nMuch like the Goths, the §YAlans§! have a long history in the region, and pre-Mongol invasion, were a force to be reckoned with. This changed when they were all but wiped out for resisting the Mongol hordes, only eking out an existence as a rump state loyal to Mongol authority. As Tatar influence wanes however, the Alans have a new opportunity to reclaim their lost glory  and strike at the vulnerable but prosperous Tatar cities of §YAstrakhan§! and Sarai. Once claimed for themselves, they will once more remind the settled peoples of Eurasia they are truly a force to be reckoned with.\n\nNeighboring Alania is another nomadic rump state - that of the §YCumans§!. Much like the Alans, they once had a fearsome reputation, perhaps more so in Europe than their Alan counterparts due to the §YMagyar Invasion§! when Cuman tribes and mercenaries helped establish the Magyar horde. Much like their Magyar counterparts, they have thus far held true to their ancestral faith in a sea of §YChristendom§!, and are all the more cruel and vicious for it. As the Tatar yoke buckles under its own weight, they too have an opportunity to strike at the Tatar homeland and plunder its riches, once more becoming a scourge of Europe and the steppe."

 string_start_ilkhanate: "Founded in AD §Y1256§!, amidst the wake of the Mongol conquests, the Ilkhanate was intended to be subordinate to the §YMongol Empire§!. However, its strength would be wasted on internal feuds more so than protecting its borders and foreign interests. Setting this precedent was §YHelagu Khan§!, first of the Ilkhans, who had been forced to contend with a war between Berke and Kublai Khan in §Y1262§!, not long after suffering a crushing defeat against the §YNizzarid Sultanate§! just two years prior.\n\nOn paper, the Ilkhans proclaimed tolerance and prosperity would be found aplenty in the lands they governed, but this policy would fall on its face before long. In the years after the conquests, the Khans became weak, the nobles stronger, and the people dissident. Blinded by their victories, they ignored the signs shown to them until the rot had already set in.\n\nThe Ilkhans' desperate bid to reassert themselves culminated in a declaration of war on the §YSeljuks§! in §Y1283§!. §YTekuder Khan§! would not live to see the end of his war, and was succeeded by §YBaydu Khan§! in  §Y1284§!. The Seljuks, employing tacticians of the now-defunct §YAyyubid Sultanate§! went into the war with the upper hand. Indeed, a wicked blow was dealt against the Ilkhan's armies, which were smote outside of §YBaghdad§! in  §Y1288§!.\n\nRefusing to admit defeat, in §Y1290§! The Ilkhan implored for the §YCrusader States§! to join against the Islamic tide. §Y1293§! marked their official entry into the war, allowing the Ilkhanate to make a desperate spearhead into the Seljuk heartland. The decade of bloody warfare officially ended in §Y1293§! when peace was agreed upon by both sides. The war was costly to all those who participated, and left most of the Near East on the verge of collapse.\n\nBy §Y1295§! Baydu Khan died and was succeeded by §YAltan Khan§!. Unlike his predecessors, Altan knew the ship was taking on water, and desperately struggled at the helm to steer the Ilkhanate out of the howling storm. Accepting that a gangrenous limb must be amputated to save the rest of the body, he had the military, treasury, and state apparatus relocated to §YShirvan§! in the Azerbaijani region by the end of §Y1315§!. As he had anticipated, §Y1320§! marked the year when the Ilkhanate would start to burst apart at the seams. \n\nAltan Khan died in §Y1349§! after reigning for 54 years, his policy of consolidation staving off imminent collapse. But Altan Khan's reforms only delayed the inevitable, and after defeating the treacherous Jalayirids in battle in 1412, Hulegu II could only watch as the upstart Warlord Shapur shattered the remaining Ilkhanid grasp on Persia, reducing the Ilkhanate to its core holdings in Azerbaijan. Now it is §Y1444§!, and Arghun II sits upon the throne. Surrounded by the re-emergent §YSeljuk Sultanate§! and the §YGeorgian Kingdom§!, the Ilkhanate is sitting on the edge of a minefield, counting down the hours until they must sally forth once more.

 string_start_gh: "When the §YMongols§! swept through Eastern Europe in the 13th century, none of the nomad of the Pontic Steppe or settled principalities of the Volga  were remotely prepared. The §YRus§! principalities all swore fealty to the Khan, the §YPoles§! and §YMagyars§! cowered before their horsemen, and the §YCuman§! khans were entirely crushed, reduced to a rump state that paid tribute out of fear, and many Cumans fleeing yet further west to escape the Mongols. The Goths of §YTheodoro§! and the §YAlans§! were also made to pay tribute, and have remained loyal subjects since, not venturing far outside of their domains.\n\nWhen the dust settled, and the Mongols began to adjust to their new status as Emperors of large swathes of the world, the various peoples of Eastern Europe found themselves under the suzerainty of the §YGolden Horde§!, otherwise known as the Ulus of §YJochi§!. Jochi's two sons, §YBatu§! and §YOrda§!, came to rule the dominions of the Golden Horde in what was intended to be a collaborative effort. However, the Mongol tradition of realm division proved to be one of the worst habits of this new state, as powerful Khans and Kingmakers often arose to dispute unified power, at the behest of continued supremacy of the Golden Horde.\n\nWhat followed was roughly two centuries of inconsistent warfare, subjugation, succession crises, and raids across the empire. Russian princes were made to pay tribute or risk having their realms pillaged. The Golden Horde frequently quarrelled with their brothers in the §YIlkhanate§! of Persia, contesting rule over Azerbaijan and Georgia countless times. Khans were often subject to plots of assassination for the purpose of destabilizing the realm or someone else seizing power. This seemingly endless cycle of bloodshed proved to be the catalyst for a very grueling and painful decline of the realm.\n\nAs the Golden Horde sunk further into civil war and became increasingly belligerent, many of its subjects began to turn away. The Rus ceased paying tribute, indignant for their treatment as pawns and suppliers. The major blow to the authority of the Golden Horde came in 1428, with the rebellion of the §Yuzbeks§! under §YAbu'l-Khayr Khan§!, who established an independent §YShaybanid§!-led state east of the Golden Horde.\n\nBy the year 1444 AD, the Golden Horde is in a sorry state. Still subject to minor Khans staging revolts, and only receiving tribute from a handful of subjects, the Empire looks to be finally in its sunset years. §YCrimean§! Princes, having grown increasingly focused on development of their ties with Eastern Europe and the Black Sea, have been whispering of defection for years. Descendants of the notorious Kingmaker §YNogai Khan§! have been calling for secession following repeated failures of recent Khans to re-establish authority over the empire. Meanwhile, the Tatars of the Volga, centered around §YKazan§!, have been noted assembling to talk about the establishment of their own Islamic state, free of the Golden Horde's tiresome machinations.

In this period of chaos, §YNur ad-Din§!, the leader of the Sunni §YZengid Dynasty§!, led a campaign into Egypt and conquered it for himself, establish the new §YAyyubid Sultanate§!. The Ayyubids would grow and expand their empire to new heights under the rule of §YSaladin§!, who managed to retake much of the holy land and expand the empire over §YSyria§!, §YArabia§!, and §YNorth Africa§!. This expansion and consolidation, along with the advancement of religious thought, science, and medicine enshrined the Ayyubids as the center of the Muslim world. They even courted the great Seljuks, introducing their leaders to the most holy of faiths in Islam.\n\nHowever, it was to be a short-lived empire. The Ayyubids would face internal strife and invasions from all sides; the Crusaders would continue to assail their shores, while internal factions divided the court. During the §YMongol invasions of the 13th Century§!, the empire would crumble. In this battle, the Ayyubid sultan was hit by a stray arrow which pierced his armor, sending him tumbling from his horse to his untimely demise. In the aftermath, factions warred with one another for control of the state, and a revolt led by the traitorous §YNizzar§! led to the utter dismantling of the Ayyubids and the creation of the §YNizzarid Sultanate§!. The empire lost all of Egypt and the Levant, while most of Syria and Mesopotamia fell to the Mongols. However, within §YDamascas§!, a sole descendant of the line of Saladin remained in power. This ruler bent the knee towards the invading Mongols, surviving under their heel. When the Ilkhanate fractured, the heirs of the Ayyubids then turned to kneel before the Nizzarids as well, scraping by in this hostile world. \n \nThe year is §Y1444§!, and the state of §YHisn Kayfa§! is a small one on the border between two great powers, the Seljuks and the Nizzarids.

With Catholic Germans and Orthodox §YRuthenians§! breathing down their necks, the ever-present threat of Viking raids from the north, and two newly-Christianized §YPolish§! tribes to the south, the disunited and disorganized confederations of Wendia have a long road ahead of them should they wish their culture to stand the test of time. It remains to be decided how this might occur. Which of the Wendish polities will unite their disparate nation?\n\nThe ever-faithful priest-kingdom of §YVeleti§! sits in a prime position to establish a united Wendia. With their central location, current subjugation of the Lusatian tribe, and custodianship of the holy §YTemple of Arkona§! on §YRujana§! island, many Wends already view the High Priest of Veleti as the spiritual leader of the entire Slavic faith. It would not be such a stretch for him to step into a more central political role among the Wendish people.\n\nTo Veleti’s west, the §YOborite§! tribe has established a state on the fringes of the German Hanseatic League. Collecting the iron price from their Christian neighbors on a regular basis, the Obotrites have become exceedingly wealthy, but are subsequently the most hated of all the Wends among their German neighbors, mainly due to the efforts of §YPribislaw§!, who attempted to convert the tribes to Christianity, but his efforts were halted by his successors. Unfazed, they continue raiding the cities of the Baltic and North Sea coastlines.\n\nPerhaps the most unassuming of the Wendish tribes are the §YPomeranians§!, the furthest-flung and least traditionally “Wendish” of the three major powers in the region. Their close ties to the Poles and Baltic §YPruthenians§! set them apart from their western neighbors. Additionally, the location of the Pomeranians’ tribal land lends itself to a more aggressive political strategy, as they are surrounded by Pagans and need not worry about drawing the ire of the German states.\n\nNo matter which tribe rises to the occasion, one thing remains true: the fate of Wendish culture lies in the balance. Will this pagan culture be able to stave off its seemingly inevitable destruction at the hands of the numerically overwhelming Christians? Only time will tell."

The kingdom supported the Norse-Gaels in their 1243 Waterford Revolt, and sponsored revolts and protected rebelling groups throughout 1395 Peasant Rebellions. They welcomed the new states back into the Irish community, hoping for a more united Ireland.\n\nHowever, the periods of warfare and bloodshed have left the kingdom weakened and drained; in the years following the 1156 Treaty of Wexford, the High Kings have had to spend all their time and energy in subduing and preventing rebellions from traitorous lords and ambitious vassals. And yet, despite the attempts to pacify the countryside, it still remains in opposition to his rule. \n \nThe year is 1444, and the current High King, Murchadh Ua Conchobair, is an aging dullard.

This saw the end of the English domination of the country; however, it was not the end to their problems.\n\nKing Owain failed to properly secure the loyalty of all his princes in the following years of his reign. He would have to constantly appease lords in the south, especially in the territory of Powys Wenwynwyn and the territory of Glywysing. While there was peace for 200 Years, in the year 1358, the King of Glywysing, Dafydd, supported by the Anglo-Saxons, raised arms against the current King Rodhri Gwynedd, the descendent of Owain the Great, and the current king of Wales. The fighting was fierce and lasted for several decades. However, when Owain Glyndwr led his forces down south, he began to win the war. In the daring encirclement of Abertawe in 1372, Owain managed to trap and capture the king Dafydd. This quickly brought an end to the conflict and awarded Owain both support and riches. In the following years, when Rodhri died without an heir, very few were surprised to learn that Owain took the throne, and even fewer dared raise a hand against him. \n \nThe year is 1444, and the current king, Maredudd ab Owain, currently rules the Kingdom. To his east, the English are weakened but not gone, and could easily wipe them off the map if they tried to. To the west, the Irish are fractured, but still strong.

After being beaten back and isolated from their Celtic cousins in §YWales§!, England affixed the boundary of their realm to the Tamar River in the early 10th century, effectively turning it into a rump state. While the Dumnonii were thoroughly humiliated, they did not take their subjugation lightly.

The Condor Dynasty declared this a great victory and a new chapter in their history began. The Cornish dukes subsequently began to rebuild a prosperous state and encourage their own culture to flourish again. Given that the English nobility were the primary landholders in Cornwall before the revolt, there were not many Anglo-Saxon local rulers to displace, giving the Condor Dynasty an easy chance to set up their new regime. However, the primary citizens in Dewnens are still the Anglo-Saxons who migrated there under English rule, for now cowed by their new overlords.\n\nThere was a marked change in Cornish politics with the ascension of one §YDuke Conan§!, who some call mad for his ambitions. While most Cornish dukes have maintained the peace with England and used the space carved out under their thumb to build a prosperous and independent realm, there are whispers that Conan aims to upset that peace and undo English rule of the island.

The successors of Svatoslav pursued a policy of fortification and careful diplomacy, securing the Amber Road and ensuring Pannonia would be drawn into no wars that could threaten its integrity. The Franks were more than happy to fund the expanded March of Pannonia as a bulwark in the east, and Pannonia soon found itself a regional link between the Franks in the West, and the various Slavs both North and South.\n\nHaving only had to fend off a minor incursion by the Croatians in the 11th Century, Pannonia has benefitted from a period of relative prosperity, allowing trade to flourish from the Baltic to the Adriatic, with Pannonia as the bridge. By 1444, Pannonia has not been in any major conflits for centuries, and its status as the sturdy eastern march of the Empire is largely forgotten. But, rumours swirl that a new wave of Magyar incursions is on the horizon, and Moravia too seems bent on resurgence. To the west, the §YBabenbergs§! of §YStyria§! grow tired of their patronage of Pannonia, and may seek expansion eastwards. In the South, Pannonia's old enemy of §YCroatia§! has maneuvered itself into a position to push its old claims towards the Danube, and the Slovenes of §YCarniola§! cast a jealous eye towards Pannonia's fertile plains. And Prince §YVladislav III§! is old and heirless, fueling further fears of destabilization. Will Pannonia once again retreat into its fortified shell, hoping the world passes it by? Or has the time come for the Slavs of Pannonia to liberate the entire basin from the Magyar yoke before it finds its way back around their necks?"

 string_start_princespersia: "At the tail end of the decades-long wars against the §YByzantine Empire§!, the catastrophically unstable reign of §YYazdegerd III§! ensured that Persia's status as a great power crumbled - heralded by the swift capture of §YCtesiphon§! by §YIslamic§! forces in AD §Y637§!. With barely more than a hastily-drafted levy as the remainder of the Persian army, Yazdegerd’s sole, saving grace was his foresight in evacuating the imperial treasury as his court abandoned the west. The additional funding it provided allowed for bolstered ranks and temporary truces with the ever-dissenting nobility, which undoubtedly ensured the decisive, albeit costly, rout of the Caliphate's armies in AD §Y642§!, at the §YBattle of Nahavand§!.\n\nThe Sassanids’ victory against the Caliphate was unable to spare them from enemies within their own state, however, as the treacherous satraps saw fit to overthrow the House of Sassan in favour of the far more popular §YMihranids§!. Despite briefly contesting the palace coup, a swiftly-fought civil war in AD §Y645§! saw a de facto end to the Sassanid Empire. The descendants of §YShahrbaraz§! would nonetheless ensure the collapse of §YUmayyad§! authority in AD 747, providing support to the §YAbbasid Revolution§!, with their mutual victory bringing about a golden age of booming commerce and stability in the Middle East.\n\nAlas, when border frictions between the two regional powers flared up in the late §Y9th§! Century, the Mihranid-Abbasid alliance was dissolved. The subsequent instability was marked by an increasing dependency on §YTurkic§! mercenaries by the Mihranid court. Little could the Mihranids do, then, when a soldier by the name of §YSeljuk§! turned his sword against his Persian paymasters in the §Y10th§! Century. Hastily beating the great houses into becoming his tributaries, the §YSeljuk Empire§! was born. Lasting until the §Y12th§! Century, Turkic dominion over Persia would eventually collapse, culminating in the §YFirst Warlord Period§!, followed shortly thereafter by the reunification of Iran by the §YHouse of Varaz§!.\n\nUnfortunately for the Varazids, though, their heavy-handed rulership invoked the ire of all the great houses. When the Sassanids beseeched §YMongol§! diplomats to intervene, and topple the Varazids, they were more than happy to oblige. Varazid forces were defeated by the Mongol-Satrap alliance in two decisive battles; §YBukhara§! and §YSamarkand§!. Ending in the total extermination of the Varazid dynasty, and a Mongol takeover of Iran, the §YIlkhanate§! began to dissolve in the §Y14th§! Century, and would slowly dwindle for the next century.\n\nWith the end of Mongol power, and the retreat of the Ilkhans to Azerbaijan, a §YSecond Warlord Period§! commenced. With a status quo lingering into the §Y15th§! Century, tensions have started to flare once more, with the rise of a new pretender - a lowborn warlord by the name of §YShapur§! - in AD 1429. Carving out large swathes of eastern Iran, this Burgher Shah has pledged that the fatal struggle between the Princes of Persia shall resume in earnest. Now only one question lingers - to whom shall victory be awarded?"

 string_start_centralasia: "Since the 1st century AD, §YChorasmia§! has been a thriving community of oasis cities; a vital link on the Silk Road between West and East Asia. Already highly autonomous, Chorasmia exploited the Sassanids' collapse after the §YFall of Ctesiphon§! in AD §Y637§!, seizing independence from the crumbling Persian Empire. Alas, the reunification of the §YGokturks§! in the late 7th Century bode ill for the fledgling realm, with the Turks rapidly preparing an invasion of Central Asia. In a desperate defence of his kingdom, Shah §YAzkajwar III§! of Chorasmia conscripted the Oghuz Turks to stave off the Gokturk menace, only to be deposed and exiled by his new soldiers.\n\nThe 8th and 9th centuries saw a patchwork of tribal alliances rise to dominance in the region. Instability persisted until the rise of the §YSeljuks§! in the 10th century, finally quelling Transoxiana's rampant warlordism. Despite initial success, however, the Seljuk Empire inevitably succumbed to stagnation and indifference, ultimately being overthrown by the Persian §YVarazid§! dynasty in the 12th century. Akin to the late Sassanids, Varazid control of Central Asia was only nominal, and the region thrived under the leadership of Khiva. Peace was not to last, though, for §YGenghis Khan's§! conquest of the Varazid Empire in the 13th century left the great cities of Bukhara, Samarkand, and the Silk Road oases lying in ruin. Only Merv, wise in its early surrender, was spared total extermination.\n\nAs the dust settled in the post conquest years, §YChagatai Khan§! took Transoxiana into his personal domain. As was typical for the Mongol Empire, infighting and blood feuds between the Uluses spurred Chagatai into waging war against §YShiban Khan’s Grey Horde§! and §YHulegu Khan's Ilkhanate§!. Embroiled in sectarian and religious disputes, the Ilkhanate would be the first to start collapsing, and for a time, the Chagatai stood firm. Unfortunately, Tarmashirin Khan’s violent persecutions of Nestorians and dissident populations in the 1330s backfired. Ultimately, the Chagatai Khanate was torn apart by vengeful §YKhitan§! and §YTocharian§! rebels, and was survived only by the rump state of §YMoghulistan§!, which in a twist of irony converted to the Nestorian faith at the behest of §YSaint Timur the Lame§!.\n\nMeanwhile, descendants of Hulegu's Persianised commander §YBahram Temur§! claimed the title of Chorasam Shahs in §YGurgan§!, while the Grey Horde pushed towards the Amu Darya. In Bukhara, an ambitious nobleman named §YAraslan Tegin§! has claimed descent from the prestigious §YAsina§! clan of the Gokturks, revolting against the Grey Horde and establishing Turkestan once again. The persecuted Manichaeans of Khiva, too, would soon join the revolt against the Grey Horde. It is now AD 1444, and the Chagatai remnant in Moghulistan doggedly clings to power, whilst the Khivan gnostics and resurgent Turkestan compete for dominance. All the while, the Chorasmians of Gurgan plot to restore the Ilkhanid legacy, and in the desolate north, Shiban Khan's heirs greedily size up the great oases they once claimed. The simmering tensions in Central Asia have risen once again, and it remains to be seen who shall rule the gateway between East and West."

Theirs is a realm - based out of §YBaghdad§!, the once proud capital of Islam - which, like many others in its near vicinity, was came into being amidst the §YIlkhanate's§! tumultuous dissolution. Initially scrapping over mere crumbs of the Mongol carcass, the first independent Jalayirid, §YHasan the Great§!, managed to defeat his competition and forge an Islamic state to stand the test of time.\n\nFor a brief period, Hasan’s might was recognised by much of Persia, but a series of costly defeats, exacerbated by the Sultan’s own death in §Y1356§!, severely destabilised the young state. Upon the death of Hasan, his son and successor §YUways§! lead the reforged Jalayirids armies against the Ilkhanate, his military prowess and administrative acumen securing many victories, and reversing the losses sustained by his father's prior defeats. This, and the brutal repression of the Nestorian monk §YSaint Timur's§! teachings, were the hallmarks of his reign.\n\nUp until Uways’s own death in §Y1384§!, the Jalayirids saw the apex of their prestige and wealth, but their decline resumed at the dawn of the 15th century. Indeed, when in 1412 - by some sort of malediction - Ilkhanid troops managed to fatally wound the sultan, Awais, driving his vastly superior army into a full rout and shattering the Jalayirid Empire. Averting a power vacuum amidst this crisis, Awais' mother, the §YKhatun Tandu§!, assumed the reins of the Sultanate until her own death in 1419.\n\nThe throne was thus passed to a lesser Jalayirid prince, §YHussein§!, in whose long reign, the state was rebuilt from the ground up. Despite reforming the army and extracting new oaths of fealty from his subjects, the struggle to maintain independence was marked by a series of wars which earnt Hussein the epithet of §YEmzik – ‘the Pacifier’§!.\n\nIt is now 1444, and Hussein of the Jalayirids has no clear heir. His prestige alone holds the sultanate together, and the realm's many princes fear what could happen should his death cripple what is left of the Jalayirid kingdom. Eyeing up what could prove a bountiful feast, vultures have started to circle over Baghdad, ready to descend at any moment."

Ravaged by the §YMongol Horde§! for its impunity in the mid 13th Century, the §YAbbasid Caliphate’s§! collapse marked the end of the §YIslamic Golden Age§!. With the sacking of Baghdad, what was once the lush and prosperous Fertile Crescent spiralled into anarchy. From the ashes of the old Islamic order rose a new Mongol ulus, the §YIlkhanate§!; a Tatar yoke upon Persian and Arab alike. Alas for the Ilkhan, petty steppe feuds bled into quarrels within the Near East, and soon the situation proved untenable. Descending into warlordism amidst the turbulent 14th Century, many more aspiring powers would make a grab for power.\n\nFor several decades, the rising §YJalayirid§! realm wrestled control over Iraq out of the disintegrating Ilkhanate’s feeble hands, although the untimely death of §YUways Jalayir§! reversed his House’s once auspicious fortunes. Seeking just cause to reassemble their fragmented legitimacy, the Jalayirids now aspire to liberate the rightful Abbasid Caliphs from §YNizzarid§! custody, and rally the Islamic world into a new Golden Age. Erstwhile, intending to relieve pressure on the §YHoly Land§!, the Crusaders found unlikely allies in the §YAssyrian§! tribes of northern Mesopotamia. Spurring these previously disunited clans into action, the province of §YNineveh§! rose in revolt against their Islamic and Mongol oppressors, devoting their energy into establishing a future free of subjugation for the Syriac Christians.\n\nOn the periphery of Mesopotamia’s alluvial plains, perched atop the foothills and bastions of the Zagros Mountains, lies the Iranian Great §YHouse of Karen§!. Disgraced in the eyes of their fellow Persian princes, the Karenids find themselves on the brink of destruction. Following the Ilkhanate’s fall, they were unable to project their rule, and now only time is on their side.\n\nMost bizarre of all, however, is the fledgling merchant republic of §YMaysan§!. Born out of a desire for profit and opposition to extortionate taxes, a clique of influential Nestorian Arab traders and bureaucrats toppled the Jalayirid governor when Uways’ empire dissolved. Encircled by hostile neighbours, tiny Maysan’s sole saving grace is the Persian Gulf, from which they can siphon enough funding to defend the city – and Christendom in Iraq. There is no harm in making a tidy profit along the way, of course.\n\nWith this myriad of conflicting interests and aspirations, and an impending warfare between the princes of Persia, it will only be a matter of time before Mesopotamia becomes a maelstrom of violence as well. In order to survive, these fertile lands must unite under a worthy hegemon, and return security to the Near East – by any means necessary."

The roots of the divisions which plague the region lie with the §YHuns§!, nomadic invaders from the steppes who overran Afghanistan completely in the §Y400s§!. Originally just one host, the Huns fragmented into numerous confederations after their initial conquests, but none would last more than a century until the §YShahis§!. Unlike the other Hunnic states, the Shahis would not suppress Buddhism, and §YBarha Tegin Shahi§! even submitted to §YEmpress Wu§! of China in AD 670, converting to Buddhism in the process. Although the Shahis could govern their majority Buddhist subjects, there were still those among the Huns who rejected Buddhism - particularly the cult of §YZun§! - Hindu dissidents whose doctrine blended steppe traditions and vedic worship. While Barha Tegin was able to keep his state together, it split upon his death, with §YSri Tegin Shahi§! staying loyal to the §YTang§! and Buddhism, while his brother §YRutbil Zabul§! took his own host under the Zunist banner. The next several centuries would see intermittent warfare between the two sides, but little would change.\n\nThe §YVarazid Dynasty of Persia§! would shatter the status quo, conquering  Afghanistan in AD 1178 and subjugating the Zunists and Shahi. The §YHouse of Suren§! would be appointed Satraps over Afghanistan from Bost by the Varazids, and by AD 1207 they had expanded to include Balkh and Ghor in their domains. However, Varazid rule did not last; the §YMongols§! under §YGenghis Khan§! shattered Persia, and by AD 1251 they turned towards Afghanistan, sacking Kabul and Bost, and putting Ghazni to the torch. The Zunists, in the wake of their holy city's immolation, retreated to the fortified citadel of Rob, the only stronghold completely untouched by the Mongol raids. The Surenas would meanwhile lose the Northern half of their domains to the §YIlkhanate§!. Mongol rule in Afghanistan was brief, as the Ilkanid governor of Ghor, §YWisnasp Ghoriyan§!, would revolt and subsequently drive the Ilkhanate out of Afghanistan entirely by AD 1283.\n\nThe downfall of the Mongol Khanates would provide much relief to the shattered lands of Afghanistan, yet within a century tensions would once again rise.

In the South, the §YSurenas§! posture as legitimate claimants to not just Afghanistan but all Persia, yet their lands are divided between Buddhists, Zunists, and Zoroastrians; the glory of their illustrious ancestors lost. The §YShahi§! are still a loose tribal federation, vulnerable to divisions and destabilisation. §YGhor§!, meanwhile, is sandwiched between Nestorians in the North and Zoroastrians in the South and West, although their military prowess has saved them from conquest so far.

 string_start_croatia: "Croatia has been an independent state since the 8th century, but its history is one of constant struggles for survival. In the 9th Century, Prince §YBraslav§! would briefly extend dominion far into Serbia and Pannonia, only for the §YMagyars§! to arrive in Pannonia, killing the Prince and with him Croatia's first chance of hegemony. Things only got worse from there: Braslav's weak successors faced invasion from Italy, and soon civil wars racked the country, and the Croatian state dissolved. After twenty years of anarchy, two pagan brothers, §YTomislav§! and §YTrpimir§!, would reunite the country, but soon the pair would formally convert to §YCatholic Christianity§!, trading their faith for a Papal crown, with Tomislav as the first King of Croatia. Under his successors the state was prosperous and stable, enjoying a century of peace. But in 1091 the §YVenetians§! would shatter this prosperity, invading Croatia with the pretext of supporting a candidate for the succession of the heirless §YStephen II§!. Instead, the Venetians would seize nearly the whole coastline, and the next decade would see bitter fighting between the two sides. Just as the Croatians were pushing into the North of Italy, the last Trpimirovic king died, plunging Croatia back into civil war.\n\nThe country would stabilise after the death of §YPeter I Snacic§!, with his nephew Ban §YKresimir Draskovic of Bosnia§! taking the throne in 1125, ending the civil strife within the country. Kresimir V would attempt to expand Croatia by force, invading Serbia and Pannonia like his distant predecessor Braslav, but his armies were routed in the §YBattle of Nis§! in 1141, only to be completely wiped out in Belgrade two years later, taking the King's life. The next century and a half saw occasional skirmishes with the Pannonians, Magyars, and Serbs, but little would change. This delicate balance was upset in the early 15th century: the §YByzantines§! in their hubris had attacked the Bulgarians, and the Tsar had promised King Mutimir Serbian lands for assistance. Mutimir I duly invaded Serbia, and as his prize took Belgrade, humiliating the Serbs. But Mutimir's reign also saw Venetian encroachment further into Croatia, and soon the stronghold of Split was under Venetian dominion.\n\nWith Croatia's gains in Serbia uncertain and their coastal cities under Venetian yoke, Croatia in the 15th century is a state in a perilous position. The Bulgarians seem set on subjugating the whole peninsula, Croatia included. The Serbs, bitter about their losses, are hell-bent on revenging themselves on their enemies. The Venetians, at the peak of their power, now see the valuable Croatian markets and look inland hungrily, a dagger pointed at Croatia's back ready to strike. And with the Magyar tribes stirring, even the Pannonians seek an end to their long slumber. With enemies abounding and friends few and far between, Balkan hegemony is still a distant dream, and yet §YMutimir II§! sees Italy on the other side of the Adriatic shining, a beautiful prize open for the taking. The question remains; shall Croatia be subsumed, or will it yet see all that and more?"

Among the Serbian principalities to First break away from the Byzantine Emperor was the principality of Duklja. In 1071 Mihalo of Duklja provided aid to the uprising of Grigori Volteh against the Byzantines Under the agreement to have his son Bodin crowned as Tsar of Bulgaria yet this involvement would prove for naught. However, the Byzantine Empire would be wracked by the Seljuk invasion of Anatolia and did little more than take hostages and demand the Serbs allegiance.\n\nThe Principality of Duklja’s hegemony over the Serbs would be fleeting. Conflicts between Mihalo's sons and his brothers would see the various principalities divided and put under the influence of other powers such as the Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia, Venice, Byzantium, and the Bulgarians. The Principaliities of Dulkja and Travuna would fall under the sway of the Byzantines, the Princpality of Zachulmia to the Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia, and would set up a Principality of Srijem centered around the city of Belgrade. Lastly, the Princes of Raska were supported by the Bulgarians.\n\nIt would be the Princes of Raska who would form the Kingdom of Serbia under the House of Nemanja, descendants of one of the brothers of Mihalo of Dulkja. In the 1280’s Raska under the reign of Stephan-Mihailo would herald a period of consolidation of other Serbian principalities as well as take advantage of a then-ailing Bulgaria to gain more land. In 1296, Stephan-Mihailo had managed to secure areas around the Great Morava River against a rival claimant of the house of Asen. In 1304 Stephan’s son Ivan defeated the principalities of Srijem and Zachumia even moving the capital to Belgrade, and by 1338, the principalities of Dulkja and Travuna were finally brought under the rule of Raska. The year 1339 would see a proclamation of Ivan II as King of the Serbs, and an unspoken challenge to them remaining a Bulgarian protectorate.\n\nThe newfound kingdom would find itself tested. Wearily watched by both its western neighbor Croatia and a now recovered Bulgaria looking to reclaim the lands seized by Stephan-Mihailo. The next seven decades would see small conflicts break out with Croatia and Bulgarian skirmishes punctuated by periods of uneasy peace and Magayr raids from the north. In 1410 however, this would change when Serbia found itself in a war with both the Croats and Bulgarians while not catastrophic saw it shorn of Belgrade and its eastern border with Bulgaria. A now weakened Serbia has found itself with few allies to turn, and the one strong enough to help them is the just as threatened Byzantine Empire.

Ask the Dukes however and their grievances are very, very real. The Southern Duchies were first formed during the §YOttonian§! period when their dissident Counts aligned with the Saxon Emperor against Paris, and were afforded status comparable to that of a Duke. This began a long rivalry between the Southern Duchies and the Emperor. This rivalry extended to the religious realm as well as political when new religious ideas came in from the Balkans. §YCatharism§!, a neo-Gnostic and dualist denomination, had begun to spread in the area from Balkan merchants around the 12th century. Starting in §YToulouse§! it crept North, gaining many converts including some lower level government officials. The Count of Nevers even issued an edict in 1396 banning discrimination against the Cathars.\n\nIn §Y1200§!, the Pope began to attempt to deal with the spreading heresy in Francia, either at the behest of the Emperor (according to the Dukes) or of his own volition (according to the Emperor). Initial attempts to reintegrate them quickly went nowhere however as the Cathars refused to accept Papal demands and the Pope also refused to budge from his religious positions. Where the Pope failed however, the aging but zealous §YEmperor Arnulf  IV§! sought to succeed. He demanded the Dukes reign in the Cathars and begin efforts to forcefully reintegrate them into the Church. The Dukes however kept making excuses as to why they couldn't until, in the early years of the 13th Century, Arnulf decided to deal with the Cathars himself, focusing on the 'bleeding heart of heresy', Toulouse itself. The resulting §YAlbigensian Crusade§! was a ferocious affair, vast sections of the Duchy of Toulouse were nearly entirely devastated. Toulouse itself was sacked in 1217 and by then the Cathars were mostly dead, converted or fled. The Emperor Arnulf IV returned to Paris to a grand celebration, leaving behind a devastated countryside an enraged Duke.\n\nThis began a series of rebellions against Paris by the Southern Dukes, usually led by the Duke of Toulouse. Some would be more successful than the others but in the end The Emperor would always prevail. However he could never fully pacify the region. When §YEmperor Robert IV§! invaded Andalusia he took many Southern soldiers as a way to ensure they didn't rise up while he was gone. When Robert and his army was destroyed, the Dukes, again under the Duke of Toulouse rose against Paris. This time they even sent a force West to seize Gascony for a cadet line of the Toulousian family. §YLothair III§!, fighting against rebellious nobles, ambitious imperial electors wanting to seize the moment and an equally rebellious peasantry, had no will or means to fight them. To avoid a war he almost certainly couldn’t win Lothair III and the Southern Dukes came to an agreement. It gave Toulouse and their allies Dukedoms ‘for their generations of service’ and significant autonomy codified in Francian law. Lothair hoped that this would’ve finally placated the rebellious South. He was very wrong. Toulouse now has a new dream, a dream of a Francia liberated from Carolingian tyranny. The lesser Dukes of Nevers and Bourbonniaes, old allies of Toulouse, come from the §YCapet§! family and are related to the Carolingians. Some whisper that Duke Raymond intends to press their claim to replace the widely hated Lothair. In any case, the present Duke of Toulouse Raymond III knows that to leave the Carolingians alone would only delay the extinction of his realm.

However, as the spread of §YChristendom§! to the east slowed, then almost fully stopped in the 1100s, it left parts of northeastern Germany still in the hands of §YSlavic§! heathen tribes.\n\nThe Christian kingdoms on their borders continued to petition the §YHoly Roman Emperor§! and the §YPope§! for assistance fighting the near constant raids from these hellish pagans. However, events elsewhere in northern Germany drowned out their pleas. Discord and chaos in §YFrancia§! left the Imperial throne open to ambitious men, and §YDuke Otto of Saxony§! seized his chance, being elected Holy Roman Emperor in 924, instead of one of the warring Frankish claimants.\n\nThe reign of the Ottonians, the §YIron Century§! as it has come to be known, led to almost all of northern Germany falling under Saxon rule or influence, being parcelled up between their close allies. For some, the §YOttonian Period§! was a time of unbridled prosperity and wealth; for others, an era of savage oppression and despotism. It wasn’t until the end of the Iron Century in the early 11th Century that the Franks retook their throne, and the Ottonians faded into the annals of history.\n\nIn 1014, Saxony was invaded by §Yvengeful Frankish armies§!, and by 1024 the Ottonians and their allies were left dead or scattered in what chroniclers came to know as the §YHarrying of the North§!. Suddenly, for the first time in generations, northern Germany was free, and it is in this precarious position that the region has persisted. With pagan raiders to the east and an ever irate Francia to the west, the north German realms are faced with §Yboundless§! possible destinies.\n\nAre they fated to §Yunite§! against the Franks once more, depose the Carolingian Emperors, and usher in a new Iron Century? Perhaps they could turn to the east, bringing about an §YOstsiedlung§! and earning §Yeternal glory§! as warriors of Christ; Or, is the destiny of northern Germany to §Ypersist§! in this fractured state, §Yprey§! to larger powers for all time? It is up to the men of the day to gamble their future, and let the dice fall as they may."

 string_start_italianminors: "Since the fall of the §YRoman Empire§! in the west, Italia, once the center of the civilised world, has been torn apart by war and petty ambition. The myriad of states that emerged from the chaos found themselves too small and fractured to avoid the prying eyes of §YCharlemagne§!. So, for a time, northern Italy lay under the complete control of the Franks. It wasn’t until the death of §YEmperor Bernard§! and the dismemberment of Francia that the northern Italian counts achieved their freedom once more.\n\nHowever, even in freedom they found trouble. Some princes, like the §YDoge of Venice§! and the §YCount of Lombardy§!, found themselves with vast domains, and soon the Lombards would leverage their advantage, uniting the Po Valley and expanding in all directions. But with the re-establishment of Carolingian power, the overextended Lombards would be fed to the wolves of Venice and their rebellious vassals. For the next few centuries, minor squabbles and encroaching Imperial power would be the main concern, but soon enough a new threat would arise.\n\nRe-established by the ambitious lords of Ifriqiya in the §Y1320s§, the §YEmirate of Sicily§! has steadily advanced northwards for generations. The Papal-led coalition of central Italian states failed to curb their rise in the §Y1340s§!, and in §Y1353§!, Naples and all of Southern Italy fell under Muslim domination. The Saracen armies have rapidly recovered from their wars and the Sultanate stands poised to take its most coveted prize yet: Rome itself.\n\n1444 finds Italy fractured; the various §YTuscan§! polities are rich but divided, the old and heirless count of §YRomagna§! risks a brutal succession dispute upon his death, and the vassal states of §Ythe Pope§! chafe at his ineptitude in fighting the Sicilians. Time will tell whether a new Italy shall rise from the ashes, or be crushed under the Saracen heel."
 string_start_title_carniola: "Princedom of Carniola"
 string_start_carniola: "Following the disintegration of §YSamo's Empire§! - a great unifying force for the early Slavs -  in 659, one of the successor states was the Principality of §YCarantania§!. Stretching across much of Austria and Slovenia, it ruled proudly over what was the frontier between the §YCarolingian Empire§! and the §YAvars§!. However, following pressure from the Avars in 740, the prince of Carantania, §YBorut§!, appealed to the Duke of §YBavaria§! for protection. This, in turn, made the Carantanians subjects of the growing Carolingian Empire. The Carantanians served faithfully as marches for the Frankish incursions into Pannonia to vanquish the Avars, but ultimately backed an ill-fated rebellion against the Franks by a Pannonian named Ljudevit Posavski.\n\nFollowing the §YRebellion of Ljudevit§!, which lasted from 819-822, the Carantanian princes were stripped of their titles and lost half of their land; demoted to dukes of §YCarinthia§! and §YCarniola§!. A new Germanic march was created in the former centre of Carantania, eventually becoming the Duchy of §YStyria §!in 970, which has since been a thorn in the side of any Carniolan ruler who attempted to assert themselves beyond Carinthia. This disgrace to the former lords of Carantania has been largely ignored by the successive German rulers of the area, especially when the Franks regained control of the Empire at the dawn of the 11th Century. Carniola is merely viewed as an unusual but irrelevant member of the Empire, with much of its history long forgotten as the Empire grew and evolved.\n\nNow Carniola stands at a precipice. The §YBabenberg§! dynasty, once rulers of both Austria and Bavaria, have been diminished to ruling merely Styria, with Bavaria stripped away to the §YWittelsbachs§! and Tirol to the §YHabsburgs §!in 1053. Though nowhere near their former might, Styria presents a challenge to any aspiring Duke of Carniola seeking to restore Carantania to its former status. The Free City of §YTrieste§! also remains a thorn in the side of the Dukes of Carniola. Formerly a part of Carniola, it remains the most valuable port for commerce besides §YVenice§!, whose leaders also eye the Carniolan holdings greedily, were it not for the protection of the Empire.\n\nYet further beyond, rumours reach the Carniolan court of §YFrancia§! being in disarray following 1443’s disaster at §YValencia§!. Should they fail to solve the looming succession crisis, it may plunge the Holy Roman Empire into turmoil not seen in centuries. An ambitious ruler may see this as a time to strike out, laying claim to what was once rightfully theirs. Others still may wish to simply preserve what they have through the coming storm. The decision ultimately falls upon the sons of Prince Borut, relegated to a corner of the Empire, pondering whether they shall raise the banner of Carantania once more."
 string_start_title_piedmont: "The States of Piedmont"
 string_start_piedmont: "Bound to the Empire, the §YPiedmont§! has always been at the crossroads between the §YFranks, Germans, and Italians§!. Conquered along with the rest of the old §YLombard§! kingdom by §YCharlemagne §!in 774, various princes were appointed to govern the region, separating it from Lombardy proper. Over a century later, Piedmont would be forced into conflict, as in 924 the §YCarolingian Emperor Bernard I§! drew his last breath, his sons waging war upon each other. The incumbent governor of the Piedmont, a man named §YAnscar§!, supported the §YSaxons§! in opposition to the Franks, but upon the dissolution of Middle and East Francia in 930, his lands were reduced to §YIvrea§!.\n\nThe 11th century saw the disintegration of formal power in the §YAlpine foothills§!, as robber barons, prince-bishops, and town councils fought off each other and outside interference. It was with the §YCrusades§! that the victorious §YAleramici of Asti§!, led by §YCount Giovanni the Brave§!, used their spoils to wage a series of wars to unite the Piedmont. Opposing them rose the line of Anscar of Ivrea, the two houses becoming mortal enemies - locked in a titanic struggle playing out over centuries to unify the region.\n\nInto this conflict strode the §YGrimaldi§! family, §YGenoese exiles§! who, from their base in §YMonaco§!, conquered §YNice§!, ruling the bishopric as a dynastic plutocracy. In 1291, they would formally enter the power struggle, marching on §YTorino§! just as the count of Ivrea had nearly conquered Asti, forcing the region into an uneasy §Ystalemate§!. The 14th Century would thus be the first time that Piedmont saw a lengthy peace since the reign of Emperor Bernard. New towns and villages sprung up to dot the foothills, as trade flowed like wine and likewise raised the spirits of the region.\n\nThis §Yprotracted peace§! was punctured by the §YAndalusian Crusade§! of 1443. §YCount Alessandro of Asti§!, seemingly secure in his preeminent position in the Piedmont, promised §YEmperor Francis§! his total support. Soon the drums of war sounded, and the crusaders marched west, finding only defeat, and for the brave men of Asti, unlike the other Italian forces present, near total annihilation. Alessandro won fame for his prowess but barely escaped with his life, and the ambitious §YBerengario of Ivrea§!, who had encouraged the Italians to abandon the rear guard during the §YBattle of Valencia§!, made him pay dearly. Swaying the §YGrimaldi§! with a hefty bribe, Berengario cornered the exhausted Asti regiment on its trek back to the Piedmont and besieged Asti itself, forcing the beleaguered soldiers to bend the knee.\n\nNot even a year later, and the Piedmont has a §Ynew hegemon§!, though one far from stable. Asti boils in unrest and Nice grows increasingly uneasy with their deal, while Ivrea looks to stabilise its hold. Although peace is restored, §Yit cannot last§!: the old King of Lombardy stirs once more, seeking to subjugate the North. Francia, reeling from the Crusade, looks ready to collapse, and the fate of the Empire is at stake. Whether the Piedmont can §Yunite§!, seize the Iron Crown, and §Ysteer the Empire§!, or perhaps forge a new one, remains to be seen."

 string_start_title_nordmark_dresden: "Margraves of Nordmark and Dresden"
 string_start_nordmark_dresden: "The §YNordmark and Dresden§! serve as the Holy Roman Empire's §Ynorthern bulwark§! against the §Ypagan Slavs§!, defending Germany's eastern border from raiding parties and invasions alike. Created in the years following the §YCarolingian Restoration §!and§Y Harrying of the North§! in 1014, the Nordmark encompasses lands denied to the §YBillung§! dynasty, who had succeeded the §YOttonians§! as Dukes of §YSaxony§! following the latter line's extinction in 1024. The borders of this new march consisted of sparsely populated woods and marshes east of the Saxon heartland, situated on the border of §YWends§!. \n\nFollowing a tumultuous nascent century, rife with little central power and margraves appointed all the way from §YParis§!, in the year 1110, the §YAskanier §!Counts of Ballenstedt were elevated to Margraves of the§Y Nordmark§!. Under the Askaniers, Nordmark was as much of a lodestone around Saxony's neck as it was a well maintained shield against the Wends and Sorbs. In contrast, the Margraves of §YDresden§! - of the §YHouse of Wettin§! - emerged from the division of §YThuringia§! as it plunged into the bloody §YBurgerkriege§!, following §YHeinrich II of Saxony's execution by Charles IV of Francia§! in 1024. Gaining recognition as a city in 1206, Dresden served as the seat of the Wettins, then just one of the many lesser noble houses in eastern Thuringia. \n\nUltimately, they would break away from Thuringian rule after the death of its duke, §YLudwig V Ludowinger§! - the only son of §YHeinrich Raspe§! - in 1280. Having chafed under the late Duke’s attempts at reigning in his nobility, §YCount Theodoric IV von Wettin§! rallied a coalition of eastern towns and magnates against the late Duke's squabbling estates. Seeking to enforce peace in eastern Thuringia before it became another §YStyria§!, the Holy Roman Emperor established the Margraviate of Dresden in 1298, tasking the Wettins with aiding the Nordmark against the Sorbs and Wends. The Ludowinger male line coincidentally became extinct that same month, allowing Theodoric to entrust a relative to the Thuringian throne.\n\nDespite the Nordmark and Dresden ostensibly defending the §YGerman third of the Empire§!, both realms were more than willing to turn their swords against one another. The positions of both marches lent themselves to §Ysix conflicts§! over trade routes, as well as missionary authority from local churches. These periodic conflicts, the §YMarcher Wars§!, began in 1320, flaring up again in 1337, 1364, 1380, and 1401 - with the most recent war having ended in 1423. Although largely untouched by the ravages of the §YHussite Wars§! and 1443's §YValencian Disaster§!, the future of the Marches remains §Yuncertain§!, their positions shaky at best. With both Saxony and Thuringia looking to §Yreclaim lost land§!, and the Slavs gradually §Yunifying§!, will the marches §Yprevail§! against their enemies, or is it their ultimate fate to be swept away?"
 string_start_title_tirol: "Duchy of Tyrol"
 string_start_tirol: "The §YHouse of Habsburg§! rose from humble beginnings, serving as little more than obscure Swiss counts a matter of centuries ago. Little did that stop them from getting in the good graces of the §YHohenstafuens of Swabia§!, southern Germany’s hegemons since the fall of the §YOttonians§! in 1024. Sending feelers out across the German realms to acquire land beyond Switzerland, in 1035 §YCount Radbot§! came upon an opportune situation in the form of §YTyrol§!, a holding of the sizable §YBabenberg March of Styria§!. Ingratiating themselves with the local dynasties, the Counts of Habsburg bought their way into this new power base, albeit having to swear fealty to the Babenbergs electors in 1039.\n\nThe §Ydynastic game§! played by the Habsburgs wasn’t new to Germany, but their practice of far-reaching marriages to key nobles secured a §Ywidespread connection§! throughout the Babenberg realm in less than a generation, much to their overlords’ ire. In an effort to clamp down on rampant opportunism and collusion with the Hohenstaufens, the Babenbergs did their utmost to curb Habsburg privileges, targeting young §YWerner III§!, viceroy of Tyrol since the death of Radbot in 1045. Furthermore, the §YSwiss cantons§! had united and started eyeing up the County of Habsburg - the dynasty’s §Yancestral home§! - when they refused to join the confederation. \n\nThe Habsburgs, now reliant on Swabian support and merely acting as petty lords within House Babenberg’s vast Alpine dominion, found their lucky break four gruelling years later, when in 1049 Styria attempted to §Yhumiliate and banish§! Count Werner. What §YHeinrich III of Styria§! had failed to account for, though, was that Werner was §Ywell connected§! due to his father’s diplomatic strategy, and friendship with Swabian duke §YFriedrich Barbarossa§!. Confident that he could hold out against the Babenbergs until Hohenstaufen support arrived, Werner raised the flag of §Yrebellion§! against his tyrannical liege, and soon, Swabian troops poured into Tyrol.\n\nAfter Barbarossa’s §Ylightning advance§! across the Alps, aided by Tyrolean climbers and scouts, the §YWittelsbachs of Munich§! mutinied against Styria in response to high war taxes. With Bavaria now joining Tyrol in rebellion against their de jure liege, Duke Heinrich withdrew further towards §YGraz§!, finally being forced to §Ysurrender§! to Werner, Barbarossa, and the myriad other delegations present in 1053.\n\nWhile Werner’s new station as §YLord of Tyrol§! was initially unrecognised, this would be rectified when the Emperor - fearing a power vacuum - bequeathed upon him the hereditary §YDuchy§! of Tirol in 1056, securing Tyrol’s §Yloyalty§! at the cost of Styria’s. Having pledged to patrol the eastern borders for §YMagyar, Hussite, or Styrian incursions§!, Tyrol was spared the ravages of the §YAndalusian Crusade§! of 1443. However, with the Empire’s power in the west failing after the §YDisaster at Valencia§!, the Habsburgs may not even be able to rely on Swabia to survive the coming deluge. "
