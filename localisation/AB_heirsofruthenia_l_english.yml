# Countries #
 SCLAVINIA: "Sclavinia"
 SCLAVINIA_ADJ: "Sclavinian"

# Cultures #
 sclavinian: "Sclavinian"

# Ideas #
 ser_first: "Gradozadanje"
 ser_first_desc: "Constant wars and border conflicts have shown a need for a more professional defensive system. From now on our forts and castles will be managed and maintained within a meritocratic and provincial system."
 ser_second: "Mining Regulations"
 ser_second_desc: "Serbia has always been renowned for its mineral wealth, even if most of these resources have historically been in Bulgarian hands. We must now centralise control over the mining operations to fully exploit our mineral wealth."
 ser_third: "Hussars"
 ser_third_desc: "Our current military crisis has given rise to large numbers of irregular light cavalry in our border regions. While mostly used for raiding and supporting larger infantry armies, they strike fear into the hearts of our enemies and are known for their ferocity in battle. By using these Hussars in a more formal position, their manoeuvrability and prowess will revolutionise European Warfare."
 ser_fourth: "Dibellion of the Serbs"
 ser_fourth_desc: "For too long the Serbs have suffered at the hands of invaders and wrongdoers. Those times end now, and with the legacy of the Romans proudly adorned on our banner, we will restore greatness to all Orthodox believers."
 ser_fifth: "Legacy of Saint Sava"
 ser_fifth_desc: "Originally a son of the grand prince of Serbia, Sava would go on to write our earliest laws and found our independent church, guaranteeing Serbian independence for years to come. We must continue this great legacy of learning and piety to stand strong against our enemies."
 ser_sixth: "Alemmanic Guard"
 ser_sixth_desc: "The richness of our lands attracts all kinds of adventurers to our court, particularly disaffected western knights. Let us use their talents as leaders of a new and fearsome royal guard."
 ser_seventh: "Autocrat of Serbs and Romans"
 ser_seventh_desc: "Our long relationship with the Romans has always been a boon to us. With the decline of their empire, we should officially declare the Greeks under our protection and merge the two states, at least diplomatically and by claiming hegemony over all the Balkans, we can certainly improve our standing abroad."

# Reforms #
 ab_ser_despotate: "Serbian Despotate"
 ab_ser_despotate_desc: "While small, the Serbian state is a well-organized and efficiently bureaucratic one, inspired by the bureaucracy of the Romans. Many court titles, government positions, and state structures drawn from Eastern Roman tradition, melded with Slavic influence to produce uniquely efficient governance."
 ab_ser_sclavinian_autocracy: "Sclavinian Autocracy"
 ab_ser_sclavinian_autocracy_desc: "Much like the earlier Serbian Despotate, the Sclavinian Autocracy draws heavily from Eastern Roman tradition to create a state structure that is a true hybrid of the Roman and Slavic worlds. The Emperor carries on the title of Roman Emperor from the Byzantines and, with it, the legitimacy and prestige of the title."
 ab_ser_pronoia: "The Pronoia System" 
 ab_ser_pronoia_desc: "Carrying on the tradition of drawing from Eastern Rome for our governance, we shall establish the Pronoia System within our state rather than the system of feudal land grants that were used previously. The small-scale land grants of the Pronoia system in return for providing the army with equipped soldiers reduce the cost of building and maintaining a standing army and increase the pool of manpower that we can draw from."
 ab_ser_logotet: "The Office of Veliki Logotet"
 ab_ser_logotet_desc: "Second only to the monarch, the Veliki Logotet (Grand Logothete) is the head of the state’s bureaucracy and aids the monarch in the day-to-day administration of the state. By promoting the power of this office, we can ensure the smooth governance of the state in the absence of a capable monarch."
 ab_ser_hajduks: "Hajduks"
 ab_ser_hajduks_desc: "Hajduks are, to some, little more than common bandits and brigands. Born in the aftermath of the Bulgarian invasion of Serbia and the fracturing of state authority after it, these men initially functioned as little more than bandits. With our state's rise again, however, we can take in these brigands and turn them into a powerful group of irregular infantrymen."
 mechanic_gain_025_army_tradition_per_battle_won_in_home_territory_yes: "Gain §G0.25§! Army Tradition per battle won in our §YOwn Territory§!"
 unlock_ab_ser_hajduks_tt: "§GUnlocks§! the §YHajduks§! Government Reform, granting §G+10.0%§! Fire Damage, §G+25.0%§! Available Loot in Provinces, §G+25.0%§! Looting Speed, and §G0.25§! Army Tradition per battle won in §Y[Root.GetAdjective] Territory§!."
 unlocked_ab_ser_hajduks_tt: "Completed Mission §YFound the Hajduks§!"
 ab_ser_caesarpapism: "Caesaropapism"
 ab_ser_caesarpapism_desc: "By formally uniting the Head of State and Head of the Church into one office, we can further solidify the unison between the Orthodox Church and the Sclavinian State. No longer will the Emperor simply be the Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans, but Emperor, Autocrat, and Patriarch!"
 unlock_ab_ser_caesarpapism_tt: "§GUnlocks§! the §YCaesaropapism§! Government Reform, granting §Y-0.5§! [Root.GetChurchOrFallbackName] Influence, §G+0.5§! Yearly Patriarch Authority, §Y+10.0%§! Manpower in True Faith Provinces, and access to the §YDivine Ideas Group§!."
 unlocked_ab_ser_caesarpapism_tt: "Completed Mission §YLegacy of the Sclavinians§!"

# Events #
 ab_serbia.1.t: "Legacy of the Sclavinians"
 ab_serbia.1.d: "The Sclavinians, our early ancestors, were an honourable and free people corrupted by the decadence of the East. Forced to adapt to a society that wasn’t theirs, the Grecians and the Bulgars tried to break our spirit, deluding themselves that we would stay down forever. Since our rebellion and return to form, the Serbian voivodeship has strived to bring itself closer to the ancient standards, uniting our cousins under the new banner. After many years of struggle and turmoil, peace and unity have returned to Sclavinia."
 ab_serbia.1.a: "Today, Sclavinia; tomorrow, all Slavs!"

 ser_turn_against_the_romans_desc: "Whilst Byzantine support has been useful to us in the past, it is clear that they are far too weak and divided to properly maintain the legacy of the Romans. The city of world's desire is within our grasp, and with it, our ascension will be secured."

 ser_triumph_levant_title: "Triumph for the Levant"
 ser_triumph_levant_desc: "As Sclavinians, it is vital that we turn our eyes to the Levant.

 ser_triumph_anatolia_title: "Triumph for Anatolia"
 ser_triumph_anatolia_desc: "Not much needs to be said about the lands of Anatolia to stress their importance. If we are truly to succeed the Byzantines, these lands must be ours. Their historical mantle is too important, and their lands too valuable to be left to the hands of foreigners."

 ser_cities_desc: "After developing the countryside, it is time to focus on our glorious cities. These urban areas are the key to centres of trade, commerce, and innovation.

 ser_pentarchy_title: "Restore the Pentarchy"
 ser_pentarchy_desc: "Justinian’s Pentarchy has been defiled by the organisation of Catholicism throughout Europe. How can we stand as a disunited church when we, as people, are united in Christ?

# Cultures #
 jadranian_culture: "Jadranian"
 talian_culture: "Talian"

# Reforms #
 croatian_feudalism: "Croatian Feudalism"
 croatian_feudalism_desc: "Croatia was founded to escape the trials and tribulations that the Croatian people experienced in Eastern Europe. The Establishment of the Croatian duchy was quaint and led to the expansion of Croatia; However, in it's decentralized stance it would become noticeable as her economy would suffer for the Military to Prosper in Size. With the Establishment of the Croatian Kingdom however, the Croatian Monarchy was centralized with Serfdom at the expense of the size of the Military. With the centralization of the Monarchy, keeping local autonomy in check was assured, but gaining men not already working in the fields became a difficult aspect for future Croatian Kings."
 banates_of_croatia: "Placating the Bans"
 banates_of_croatia_desc: "Croatia now increasingly becoming Centralized at the kings appointment would appoint regional nobility within the Croatian Kingdom. These titles would soon become known as 'Bans' which would be almost an equivalent of a Duke of Count, but appointed by the King. With the Placating of the Bans and the further Centralization of the realm under these local nobles to help the realm's administration we can not only see to their loyalty, but to larger swaths of recruitable potential out of their Banates."
 zupans_of_croatia: "Župans of Croatia"
 zupans_of_croatia_desc: "The Župans are local administrators of the Croatian Realm. Most being of noble nature or appointed on the ties of meritocracy, these Zupans would be key to administrating the realm and keeping local populations in check. With these Župans we can insure a stable realm while also pulling away power from the Banates of Croatia."
 venetians_in_croatia: "Venetian Podestas"
 venetians_in_croatia_desc: "With Increased Venetian influence and their growing power, why should we have to fight these avaracious merchants? If we perhaps add to their wealth and open our markets to Venetian traders creating a larger merchant class in Croatia we could perhaps turn their wealth and knowledge to be a profitable exchange for Croatia. Why dispell these Merchants when they offer us vast amounts of wealth."
 establish_banderium: "The Croatian Banderium"
 establish_banderium_desc: "The Banderium is the Croatian system of levying soldiers for war. The System in Croatia functions on banner corps of soldiers whom share heraldy to the city or province of which they were recrited from or, of the personal army of Croatia. These banner regiments would be recruited into the army to establish a formal system of conscription and training. An added side effect would be the pride gained from the honor of fighting for their colors, thus, increasing Morale."
 slavonic_liturgy: "Slavonic Liturgy"
 slavonic_liturgy_desc: "Slavonic Liturgy in Croatia was important to the rise of Christianity and Catholicism in Croatia. With rights exclusively given to the slavs by the Pope and rising religion in Croatia the Glagolitic script of the Slavonic liturgy thrived in Croatia as a means to spread the liturgical practices of the pope. With the Glagolitic scripts replacing that of Latin and Croatian continued use of these scripts Papal Influence in Croatia has dwindled, but the Faith has remained strong and fervent in Croatia."
 croatian_chamberlains: "Chamberlains of Croatia"
 croatian_chamberlains_desc: "The Chamberlains of Croatia was an administrative position given out by King Kresimir upon his reformation of the Croatian Royal court. The Chamberlains would be the king's arm to the estates and would have a ministry to weaken and deny these administrative figures the ability to mount a resistance to the centralizing Croatian Monarchy. While this does instil some corruption in the chain, the title was given out based on merit and would be transitioned during the rule of Kresimir and future heirs of Croatia aiding in a well advised reign and court."
 pacta_conventa: "The Pacta Conventa"
 pacta_conventa_desc: "The pacta conventa ratified by the Croatian Nobles upon the succession of Kresimir was ratified as an outstanding treaty that defined the succession of Croatia and the Kingdom firmly within the hands of Croatian leaders to prevent succession crisis and wars of succession. The pacta conventa defined Croatian law as semi salic primogeniture succession, in the case their is not an heir the most senior descendent of the brothers of the King shall be the successor if they are above the age fit to become king. With the pacta conventa a council of nobles would be setup in the case of a succession crisis to determine and see fit that an heir comes to the throne."
 croat_talian_reforms: "The Italo-Croatian Reforms"
 croat_talian_reforms_desc: "The Italo-Croatian Reforms implemented to foster trade growth and the production of goods within Croatia would be a rather strategic reform nationally. The Reforms promoted influx of Italian craftsmen into croatia promoting migration into the Kingdom to foster growth of the economy and the trade of goods. With Merchants from all over the World most important those from Italy wanting to pawn the goods of Croatia the reforms promoted artisanry goods and the production of goods to aid the mercantile trade abroad."
 croatian_absolutism: "The King of All Croatians"
 croatian_absolutism_desc: "Croatian Absolutism has existed during all throughout Croatian History. In it's infancy it promoted the meritocratic and absolute divine power of the King, but now in it's prime Croatian Absolutism blosooms as enlightenment expands upon the realm. With the King's rising power the King would crack down on the banates and would embrace the idea of Enlightened Absolutism." 

# Events #
 ab_croatia.2.t: "Fall of Venice"
 ab_croatia.2.d: "A seismic shift has occurred in the balance of power along the Adriatic; the once-mighty Republic of Venice has fallen. This event sends ripples through the political and economic landscape, opening new opportunities and challenges for Croatia. No longer will another regional power threaten our ports and coasts. No longer will slimy Italian hands meddle in our internal affairs. The Adriatic is our bay, our home. As the tides of power ebb away from Venice, we must decide how to position ourselves in this new era. Will we extend our influence over former Venetian territories or seek to fill the economic void left in their wake?"
 ab_croatia.2.a: "Seize the moment, for fortune favors the bold."
 ab_croatia.3.t: "The Adriatic Empire"
 ab_croatia.3.d: "A new era dawns as Croatia emerges as the formidable 'Adriatic Empire.' The fragmented states and principalities along the Adriatic coast have been unified under our flag through strategic insight and decisive leadership. This monumental achievement has shifted the regional balance of power, establishing Croatia as the region's preeminent maritime and economic force. The dream of a grand Adriatic future is now a resplendent reality, though it brings with it the weight of new challenges and the duty to lead with wisdom and strength."
 ab_croatia.3.a: "Embrace our destiny as the masters of the Adriatic."

 cro_retaliation_title: "Croatian Retaliation"
 cro_retaliation_desc: "Dark clouds amass on the horizon. Enemies leer hungrily at our lands. All around us, they stand in wait - the ambitious Bulgars, the greedy Venetians, the ravenous Magyars. If these conquerors do not devour us, then another power surely will. We must not lay down and die here - Croatia must retaliate, take back what is hers!"
 cro_braslavs_legacy_title: "Braslav's Legacy"
 cro_braslavs_legacy_desc: "The legendary Prince Braslav once dared to dominate Pannonia and even Serbia. However, the treachery of the roaming Magyar horde and the weakness of his successors proved too much for our fledgling realm. Pannonia was lost - but now, centuries later, it stands vacant and idle once more, vulnerable to our advances. Now is our chance to reclaim Braslav's honour!"
 cro_blatnograd_title: "The City of Blatnograd"
 cro_blatnograd_desc: "Pannonia is a fertile and beautiful land - one cannot deny that. It proves flat, hospitable and a stepping stone for trade deeper into Europe. One also cannot deny, however, the devastation that has befallen the area as a result of repeated conquests and the toil of warfare. We must prove to its inhabitants that we are wiser and more beneficial overlords than the Magyars - Blatnograd must stand tall!"
 cro_cross_the_danube_title: "Cross the Danube"
 cro_cross_the_danube_desc: "The ruinous Magyars have lived for far too long! From across the Carpathians, the murderous marauders leapt, razing and pillaging everything in their path. Never have they moved on, however - always slipping through the fingers of greater powers, persisting despite God's grace. Perhaps we have a duty to put an end to their existence?"
 cro_pacta_title: "Pacta Conventa"
 cro_pacta_desc: "Carpathia is a land with clear boundaries. Sprawling, ancient rivers, immovable, frosty mountains and boundless farmlands - a country ripe for the taking. Yet for centuries now, petty powers have squabbled and wrestled over innocent Carpathia's carcass. Should this cycle not come to an end? Should the banner of great Croatia not ripple high in the Carpathian sky? Should the cross not reign here forevermore?"
 cro_control_dubrovnik_title: "Control Dubrovnik"
 cro_control_dubrovnik_desc: "A most foul testament to Venetian ambition stands just south of our holdings - Dubrovnik, controlled and dictated by the Ragusan mob. With Dalmatia back under our control, it is only fitting we tidy up the rest of the Italian mess splattered across our coastline."
 cro_recover_dalmatia_title: "Recover Dalmatia"
 cro_recover_dalmatia_desc: "The vile Venetians have exhausted our patience. Again and again, the wily merchants of the so-called 'serene republic' have encroached upon the Balkans - disguising their greed in virtuous noise, laying waste to innocent seaside towns with mercenary rabble. Dalmatia is rightful Croatian land - let it be known!"
 cro_annihilate_venice_title: "Annihilate Venice"
 cro_annihilate_venice_desc: "We cannot allow the serene republic to exist as a functional entity. For as long as Venetian traders roam the Mediterranean, the Balkans will never be safe from their grubby fingers. Their beloved city and bountiful core lay within our grasp - let us squeeze and never let go!"
 cro_unite_with_the_slovenes_title: "Unite with the Slovenes"
 cro_unite_with_the_slovenes_desc: "The Slovenes, a people not much different from our own, stand vulnerable before the gates of the Holy Roman Empire. They would benefit better beneath our banners instead of foolhardy and naive self-determination - lest they be gobbled up by the Germans, or worse, Venice."
 cro_conquer_serbia_title: "Conquer Serbia"
 cro_conquer_serbia_desc: "Years ago, we were promised Serbian lands - but a sliver we were granted. Our appetite stands unsated - God knows we deserve more. For truly, the lands of the Serbians are ruled by heretical rabble, adhering to the tired and weary churches of the east. Let us sweep up the dust that is Orthodoxy - and do away with the silly idea of a Serbian state, independent."
 cro_clash_with_bulgars_title: "Clash with Bulgars"
 cro_clash_with_bulgars_desc: "The Bulgars, boastful and ambitious, see themselves as the undisputed hegemon of the Balkans - successors to the Romans, safeguards against the distant Turkish menace. This attitude is foolish - and must be amended, by force, if Croatia wishes to exist as an independent and powerful entity."  
 cro_south_slavic_union_title: "South Slavic Union"
 cro_south_slavic_union_desc: "At last, a new dawn's light eases its way across the Balkans. The southern Slavs see peace beneath a united banner - ours. It is only fitting that we now become bolder in our ambitions - proclaim ourselves a hegemon and uniter of all the Slavs of the Balkans and heirs apparent to the ancestral peoples, the Illyrians."
 cro_slavicize_the_italians_title: "Slavicize the Italians"
 cro_slavicize_the_italians_desc: "Italy stands ripe for the picking. Having negated the Venetian menace, the cities, rivers, and coastlines of the vast and ancient peninsula await us, beckoning. To our surprise, we find our eager populace yearning for new horizons, opportunities, and beginnings - in the form of new land. Perhaps we could settle them in our new Italian holdings."
 cro_italian_invasion_title: "Italian Invasion"
 cro_italian_invasion_desc: "For as long as any powers not of our own exist in Italy, we will be threatened by their proximity. We have proven to ourselves and the world our claim to the Venetian lands - why not extend our reach and claim the rest? A more peaceful Mediterranean awaits... a more Croatian Mediterranean, too."
 cro_adriatic_empire_title: "Adriatic Empire"
 cro_adriatic_empire_desc: "This sea is ours. Do you not feel it? Do you not feel the longing as you gaze upon the sombre waves of the Adriatic? Do you not feel the pride as you hear Croatian songs and fanfare throughout streets once Dalmatian, halls once Ragusan? Do you not feel mild amusement as you see a tattered Venetian banner rotting in the passing waves? We certainly do, at least - so we feel it is only fitting that we are the Adriatic's sole power."
 cro_zvonimirs_seat_title: "Knin, the Seat of Zvonimir"
 cro_zvonimirs_seat_desc: "Knin's storied walls have borne witness to the rise and fall of kings; its restoration as the heart of Croatian kingship is overdue. Reviving its fortresses and palaces will honour King Zvonimir's legacy and signify national rejuvenation. By renewing its cultural and administrative significance, Knin can become a beacon of Croatian identity and statehood, where history and progress intertwine."
 cro_slavonian_breadbasket_title: "Breadbasket of Slavonia"
 cro_slavonian_breadbasket_desc: "The rich soils of Slavonia have fed our nation for centuries, yet they hold untapped potential. Modernising agricultural practices and irrigation systems can transform this region into a model of efficiency and abundance. By focusing on crop diversity and sustainable practices, Slavonia can become Croatia's breadbasket and a leader in European agriculture, bolstering our food security and economic independence."
 cro_revitalize_the_economy_title: "Revitalise the Economy"
 cro_revitalize_the_economy_desc: "Croatia's economy, rich in potential, stands at a pivotal moment. Strategic investments in infrastructure, technology, and education can spur a new era of growth and innovation. By encouraging business and entrepreneurship we can attract foreign investment, boost exports, and enhance our global competitiveness. This economic revitalization will lay the groundwork for a prosperous future, creating opportunities for all Croatians."
 cro_industrialize_croatia_title: "Industrialize Croatia"
 cro_industrialize_croatia_desc: "The Industrial Revolution offers an unprecedented opportunity for national transformation. Prioritising sectors such as shipbuilding, textiles, and manufacturing, and supporting them with infrastructure and innovation can propel Croatia into the forefront of industrial nations. This journey towards Industrialization must also be sustainable, balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship. By harnessing our human and natural resources, we can build a resilient, dynamic, and inclusive economy."
 cro_croatian_government_title: "Strengthen the Sabor"
 cro_croatian_government_desc: "The Sabor, our historic assembly, is the cornerstone of Croatian democracy. Enhancing its authority and efficacy will ensure that our policies reflect the voices of our nation. Strengthening this institution involves legislative reform but fostering a culture of robust debate and public engagement. An empowered Sabor will be pivotal in guiding Croatia through the challenges of the modern world, ensuring that our governance is responsive and responsible."
 cro_naval_powerhouse_title: "Naval Powerhouse"
 cro_naval_powerhouse_desc: "As a nation cradled by the Adriatic, Croatia's destiny is intertwined with the mastery of the seas. Establishing ourselves as a naval powerhouse involves more than expanding our fleet; it requires integrating advanced naval technology, comprehensive training programs, and strategic maritime bases. This endeavour will reinforce our defences and enable us to influence the political and economic dynamics of the Mediterranean. A formidable presence on the waves will solidify our status as a key regional player and guardian of crucial sea lanes."
 cro_merchant_fleet_title: "Build a Merchant Fleet"
 cro_merchant_fleet_desc: "A thriving merchant fleet is the lifeblood of a prosperous nation. By constructing a versatile and robust fleet, we can tap into the lucrative trade routes that crisscross the Adriatic and beyond. This initiative will involve incentivizing shipbuilding, nurturing maritime trade relations, and establishing Croatia as a hub of commerce. As our merchant ships traverse the globe, they will not only bring wealth to our shores but also carry the influence and culture of Croatia to distant lands."
 cro_trading_cities_title: "Expand the Trading Cities"
 cro_trading_cities_desc: "Croatia's historic trading cities - bustling hives of commerce and culture - are the engines of our economic growth. Expanding and modernising cities like Dubrovnik, Split, and Rijeka will catapult them into prominence as centres of trade, tourism, and innovation. Investments in infrastructure, beautification, and cultural heritage projects will enhance their economic potential and allure as global destinations. As these cities flourish, they will serve as beacons of Croatian enterprise and ingenuity, drawing merchants, artists, and diplomats from all corners of the world."
 cro_vinodol_code_title: "Revise the Vinodol Code"
 cro_vinodol_code_desc: "The Vinodol Code, a cornerstone of Croatian medieval law, has guided our legal principles for centuries. To adapt to the evolving needs of our society, it is imperative to revise this ancient code. This revision process should modernise our legal system while preserving the essence of the traditional laws that have shaped our nation. By balancing historical wisdom with contemporary justice, we can ensure that our legal framework is fair, progressive, and reflective of our national identity."
 cro_naval_capacity_title: "Boost the Naval Capacity"
 cro_naval_capacity_desc: "As we venture into an era where maritime strength dictates national security and influence, boosting our naval capacity becomes paramount. This expansion means augmenting our fleet with more vessels and equipping them with cutting-edge technology. It involves strategic investments in naval infrastructure, including ports and shipyards, and developing new naval doctrines that match our ambitions. A formidable naval capacity will be the backbone of our defence and a deterrent to those who might challenge our sovereignty on the seas."
 cro_marine_colleges_title: "Marine Colleges"
 cro_marine_colleges_desc: "The mastery of the seas requires knowledge as much as it does valour. Establishing marine colleges is a crucial step in cultivating a new generation of seafarers, naval strategists, and maritime scientists. These institutions will become crucibles where naval theory and practice converge, fostering innovation and excellence. Through rigorous training and research, our marine colleges will supply the navy with skilled personnel and contribute to the broader maritime sector, enhancing our nation's reputation in naval architecture, oceanography, and marine conservation."
 cro_religious_mission_title: "Religious Mission"
 cro_religious_mission_desc: "Croatia's rich spiritual heritage is a tapestry of faiths, with Christianity at its core. A renewed religious mission aims to strengthen this spiritual foundation through the revival of religious institutions, promotion of interfaith dialogue, and support of missionary activities. This mission is not merely about religious observance; it's about fostering a sense of unity, moral fortitude, and cultural identity. By nurturing our religious roots, we can ensure that faith remains a cornerstone of Croatian society, guiding its ethical and social development."
 cro_bulwark_of_christianity_title: "Antemurale Christianitatis"
 cro_bulwark_of_christianity_desc: "Historically regarded as the 'Antemurale Christianitatis', or the Bulwark of Christianity, Croatia has long stood at the frontiers of Christendom. In these turbulent times, this role takes on new significance. Strengthening our commitment to this legacy involves bolstering our defences and promoting Christian values and humanitarian principles. It is a call to be a beacon of hope and resilience, a defender of faith and liberty against any forces that threaten the peace and unity of Christendom. In embracing this role, Croatia reaffirms its historical identity and place in the modern world."
 cro_royal_navy_title: "Kraljevska Mornarica"
 cro_royal_navy_desc: "The Adriatic Sea is the lifeline of our Kingdom. If we are to survive, it is imperative that we establish a strong naval force capable of defending our coastline and protecting our naval trade."

# Reforms #
 polthirdrome: "The Third Rome"
 polthirdrome_desc: "We have firmly established Poland as one nation under God. With Christ legitimizing our rule, it seems only fit to lay full claim to our rightful place as the successor of Rome. With our ruler as our Caesar and the Sejm as our Senate, who in truth could deny our claim to be the inheritors of Rome’s legacy?"
 polestablishsejm: "Establish the Sejm"
 polestablishsejm_desc: "While the Crown of Poland has long relied on its estates for the administration of our nation, this has, legally speaking, been largely informal and done through irregular, archaic diets. To this, we say: no longer! By establishing the Sejm as an official legislative branch of our government and by including the Szlachta, Clergy, and Burghers, we can ensure the smooth running of our government."
 polempowertribal: "Empower the Old Tribal Leaders"
 polempowertribal_desc: "While the culture of our fair nation is now united, some old tribal lines are still drawn among the population, memories of days prior to the unification of our state. Rather than trying to suppress this, it would seem that by empowering the Christianized Pagans and the previously Catholic nobles in the northwest, we can ensure further unity within our state."
 polpolishpatriarchate: "Establish the Polish Patriarchate"
 polpolishpatriarchate_desc: "Now that we have secured Poland's lands for the one true faith, it would seem only reasonable to establish our own autocephalous Patriarchate, separate from those to the south and east. By doing so, we are sure to increase the influence and loyalty of the Church within our borders while also aiding us in our diplomacy with fellow nations of the true faith."
 polorthodoxclergy: "Promote the Orthodox Clergy"
 polorthodoxclergy_desc: "In our mission to propagate the true faith among the Lechitic peoples, we have come to rely heavily upon the Orthodox churches and basilicas across our nation to help in the administration of the vast lands we now hold. By further integrating the clergy into our bureaucracy, we can surely further spread the message of Christ and ensure the loyalty of the faithful."
 polbearers: "Bearers of the Cross"
 polbearers_desc: "While we Orthodox do not crusade like those who follow the Latin Rites, we have built a strong, noble class of pious warriors in the formation of our nation. This caste of old Lendian nobility that has led the charge against the Pagans and the Latins is an invaluable asset to our state, and as such, we should promote them and grant them the privileges they have earned."
 polonenationunderthegods: "One Nation, Under the Gods"
 polonenationunderthegods_desc: "With our faith reformed and organized, it is evident we have become a beacon of piety among a sea of heathens and heretics. While there are many tribal divisions and cultural minorities still within our nation, by unifying all under the guidance of our faith, headed by our ruler, we can ensure stability and prosperity for the peoples of our nation."
 polorganizefaith: "Organize Our Faith"
 polorganizefaith_desc: "We have reformed the Slavic faith, dragging it into modernity, building great temples that rival those of Christendom, and setting down an official canon of our holy texts, no longer relying purely on oral tradition and mismatched tomes. Now that this has been done, it seems only fitting to officially organize our clergy with our ruler serving as leader of the faithful, of course."
 polintegrateclergy: "Integrate the Clergy"
 polintegrateclergy_desc: "Due to ruling over vast swathes of heathens and new converts to our faith, the clergy of Poland have become incredibly powerful over the proceeding years. By integrating them into our bureaucracy and allowing them to further build their power structure in our nation, we can ensure that they both propagate the faith and integrate our new possessions."
 polenoble: "Ennoble Warriors of Faith"
 polenoble_desc: "In our progress in unifying Poland, a great many successful warriors have come forward and led our soldiers to victory after victory. By rewarding these faithful members of what was once our humble tribe with nobility and lands in our newly conquered lands, we can ensure we have loyal members of the Szlachta to rule over the Heathens."

# Events #
 ab_poland.1.t: "The Assimilation of Silesians"
 ab_poland.1.d: "Having overcome centuries of division along religious and tribal lines, the birth of a unified Polish state has strenghtened the national identity of Lechitic peoples. The sense of pride and accomplishment inspires Lechitic tribes to declare themselves a part of the Polish nation, and today, we celebrate the admission of Silesian people into the Polish nation!"
 ab_poland.1.a: "Great!"
 ab_poland.2.t: "The Assimilation of Pomeranians"
 ab_poland.2.d: "Having overcome centuries of division along religious and tribal lines, the birth of a unified Polish state has strenghtened the national identity of Lechitic peoples. The sense of pride and accomplishment inspires Lechitic tribes to declare themselves a part of the Polish nation, and today, we celebrate the admission of Pomeranian people into the Polish nation!"
 ab_poland.2.a: "Great!"
 ab_poland.3.t: "The Birth of Lendia"
 ab_poland.3.d: "When Mieszko's kingdom collapsed as a result of his foolish actions and the ignorance of the tribal chieftains, Poland was immolated upon its own burning stake. The Lendian tribes were spared, isolated from the infighting from fortunate geography. As they watched the horrors committed by both, they turned to another faith entirely. With the support of the Ruthenian princes and the legacy of the Great Moravians, the Lendian people were welcomed to the Eastern Orthodox Church. Empowered by the monolith of belief in Eastern Europe, we were able to extinguish the infighting and efface the horrors. Under the name of Lendia and with the teachings of Cyril and Methodius, the Polish people will found a new path!"
 ab_poland.3.a: "May Saints Cyril and Methodius light our new path!"
 ab_poland.4.t: "The Third Rome"
 ab_poland.4.d: "As we outgrew the bustling woodland home that had once given our people warmth, we saw what the other lands had to offer. A false Empire lies in the west, piddling margraves squabbling over meagre trophies pilfered from peaceful Slavic towns. To the east and beyond are what can only be described as barbarians, brutes who seek to destroy civilisation - if only to bring others to match their own deficiency. Though we stand united under the Patriarchates, we are each splinters, a brittle phalanx hammered without pause. To become something greater, the idea of a pan-Slavic union bonding the brothers of the Eastern Orthodox faith was put forth. With infighting desecrating the heart of the Orthodox Church, they will turn to us for refuge and hospice. We will forge a new Rome; a Third Rome!"
 ab_poland.4.a: "Even if a tremendous storm rises above us, we will always stand firm like castle walls"
 ab_poland.5.t: "Ascendant Lechia"
 ab_poland.5.d: "The reunification of the Polish people under the banner of Lechia has become a shining beacon in the darkness of these uncertain times. A resilient people, the children of Lech stand together for only the second time since the Heathen king Mieszko. His desperate ploy to prevent attacks from German margraves and centralise his own power by converting to Catholicism had disastrous consequences, when our decisive chieftains rejected his decrees. \n\n It stands as our eternal duty to protect and unite those who share in the blessings of Perun, and materialise the strength the Old Gods have blessed us with. Like those who stood before us, we will remain loyal to Perun and Weles, and spurn any who dare to challenge that! Great King, ascendant Lechia!"
 ab_poland.5.a: "We are all children of Lechia. Thy mighty Perun, may you give us strength!"
 ab_poland.6.t: "Great Lechia"
 ab_poland.6.d: "Once, we were but a tiny tribe that dreamed of the ebbing seas. A fragment of desperate mistakes, a piece of something greater. As we sought to protect the quivering flames of the Old Gods, we achieved and spread our roots further than ever before. As our kingdom grew, so did our ambitions; the temples of the Old Gods spanned all of Eastern Europe, and we reclaimed what we lost centuries ago. Now, the name Great Lechia echoes throughout Europe. Our banners soar from the North Sea to the Baltic, from the holy Sleza to the Black Sea. A union of many cultures, manifesting from the remains of the Great Moravians and the Kievan Rus', the rising Intermarium is a blend of many legacies once past! Under our wondrous rule, the proclamation of the Wielka Lechia will signal the dawn of the Lechitic Empire!"
 ab_poland.6.a: "From Arkona to Sleza, betwixt Krolewiec and Kijow, our Amber Road unites sea to sea!"
 ab_poland.7.t: "Legacy of Mieszko"
 ab_poland.7.d: "Poland has been the outpost of Catholicism in the East ever since King Mieszko I was baptized in the Western Latin Rite in 966 AD, and his successors swore alleagiance to the Holy See. The dastardly tribal chieftains rejected Catholic missions under the banner of Piast, and instead banded together to plunge the kingdom into civil war. We retreated to our seat of power in Poznan, knowing that enemies were on all sides. Proving to be a sagacious move, the chieftains returned to squabbling between each other in idiocy. With Papal blessing to remove the archaic beliefs of an unenlightened people, our armies struck swiftly and aimed true, felling the tribes once and for all. We will learn from our mistakes to restore the honour of House [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] and the legacy of Mieszko!"
 ab_poland.7.a: "Declare the Civitas Schinesghe. Gaude Mater Polonia!"
 ab_poland.8.t: "An Empire Between the Seas"
 ab_poland.8.d: "When we first reclaimed our legacy and restored what was lost in civil strife, the Polish people were at a loss. They had fought so fiercely in reviving Mieszko's kingdom, there was never a plan for what came after. The vision of the Intermarium was birthed when the Pope expressed a desire to return Eastern Europe into the purview of the Roman Catholic Church, once lost to the Eastern Orthodox Church following the events of the Great Schism. With God's will, we crusaded against heathens and heretics alike, bringing forth the light of Catholicism to the endless woodlands and plentiful grazing lands spanning Eastern Europe. Now, we have reached the bounds of the Earth itself, reaching from the frigid Baltic to the temperate Black Sea. Those who have lost their way have rediscovered the torch-lit path, and those who traveled another path entirely have been apprised of a better one. Armed with new brothers and sisters in faith, who shall dare stand against us?"
 ab_poland.8.a: "If God is with us, then who is against us?!"
 ab_poland.9.t: "Arrival of the Hussites"
 ab_poland.9.d: "When our great King Mieszko first converted to Catholicism against the wishes of the Slavic chieftains all those centuries ago, the unity of the Roman Catholic Church was undoubtedly stronger than it was today. However, with the Great Schism irrevocably tearing Christendom in two, there are many who have questioned if either were the right path at all. The writings and proclamations of Jan Hus brought many of these questions to the forefront, adding fuel to the raging inferno upon the Western Schism between Rome and Avignon. We watched the horrors and untold devastation wrought during the Hussite Wars, and now that no mattter how we align as brothers in faith, these cursed Catholic margraves will kill, burn and pillage just the same as they would to any heathen town.\n\nThe Bohemian declaration of Jan Hus' teachings to be part of the state religion has brought many of their theologians and missionaries across the grasslands into Poland, to convince us to do the same. We must decide now; should we attempt set the example for these wayward Catholics and become their lightbearer? Or shall we follow in the teachings of Jan Hus, and rejoin our Slavic brothers in the fight against the Roman Catholic Church's failings?"
 ab_poland.9.a: "We must show these lost souls the right path."
 ab_poland.9.b: "Jan Hus was right all along!"
 ab_achiev.87.d: "Congratulations, you have earned the achievement §GScream if You Love Poland§!.\n\nForm Poland and have 200 relations with at least 20 nations."
 ab_achiev.88.d: "Congratulations, you have earned the achievement §GPolska Gurom§!.\n\nForm Poland and own all mountain provinces in the world."

# Missions (Pagan) #
 pol_pagan_rally_tribal_warriors_title: "Rally the Tribal Warriors"
 pol_pagan_rally_tribal_warriors_desc: "The fracturing of Poland into local tribes after folly of the Christian king Mieszko and his attempts to Christianise the realm, and the collapse of our once ally, the Great Moravian empire, has left us vulnerable and open to attack from all sides by heretics and heathens alike. We must rally the warriors and unify the Polish people once more!"
 pol_pagan_consolidate_silesia_title: "Consolidate Silesia"
 pol_pagan_consolidate_silesia_desc: "Silesia gained independence during the fall of Great Moravia. Although the Moravian kings attempted to Christianise Silesia, the highlands proved too arduous of a journey for the missionaries and were ultimately unsuccessful. It falls to us to protect them from the greedy hands of the Christian princes of the Holy Roman Empire."
 pol_pagan_sleza_title: "Sleza, the Holy Mountain"
 pol_pagan_sleza_desc: "Sleza has been the centrepiece of the Slavic worship, even before the shrines of our pantheon were built. The stone rings encircling our holy mountain and the mysterious animal sculptures dotting the mountainside existed before we settled these lands. As long as they exist, the Slavic faith will remain, and the strength our belief will never waver."
 pol_pagan_christians_title: "Purge the Christians"
 pol_pagan_christians_desc: "The Christians will always remain a threat to our ways - both external threats launching crusading campaigns into our homeland, and internal threats - like Mieszko - aiming to enthrone their legacy into history. They must be purged from our lands, or we will never be able to stand up to the wolves lurking in the shadows..."
 pol_pagan_shrines_title: "Shrines of the Old Gods"
 pol_pagan_shrines_desc: "The holy lands of the Slavic people have withstood the test of time, still and unchanging unlike the people who come before it. The shrines of the Old Gods remain as our link to the past in these uncertain times. We must preserve them at all costs."
 pol_pagan_perun_title: "Invoke Perun's Wrath"
 pol_pagan_perun_desc: "Perun, our almighty and supreme god. He who is of thunder and lightning, of oak and fire, and a god of warriors shall bless our swords and share his thunderous wrath with our dragoons. We shall invoke his patronage on those who dared to abandon him for false gods and pretentious idols. Invoke His wrath, and victory will come to us!"
 pol_pagan_crush_the_lendians_title: "Crush the Lendians"
 pol_pagan_crush_the_lendians_desc: "The Lendians, much like the foolish descendants of Mieszko ruling Greater Poland, turn to Christianity and evangelised much of their realm. However, unlike Mieszko's blood, they turned to the Eastern Orthodox Church instead in face of their Great Schism. Foreign support for the Lendians from their fellow believers will make them our biggest threat, so we must strike swiftly, and crush them now!"
 pol_pagan_end_bloodline_title: "End Mieszko's Bloodline"
 pol_pagan_end_bloodline_desc: "Though the rulers of Polans claim their descendancy of the only Polish king, Mieszko, it was his ambitions to Christianise the realm that ultimately lead to its demise. It is not out of the question that if they are left to their devices, they will attempt the same thing once more. The blood of our people is on their hands, and we should never deign to forget this!"
 pol_pagan_sons_of_lech_title: "Unite the Sons of Lech"
 pol_pagan_sons_of_lech_desc: "No matter how the recent times have unfolded, we should never forget that we were all children of Lech, one of the three legendary founders of the Slavic people. United by a shared history, the Polish people should once again become one. Let us unite the sons of Lech, and bring a new age for our people."
 pol_pagan_lechia_title: "Ascendant Lechia"
 pol_pagan_lechia_desc: "The reunification of the Polish people under the banner of Lechia has become a shining beacon in the darkness of these uncertain times. A resilient people, the children of Lech stand together for only the second time since the Piast king Mieszko. This time, we will remain steadfast in the name of Perun, and spurn any who dare to challenge that! Great King, ascendant Lechia!"
 pol_pagan_access_the_baltic_sea_title: "Access the Baltic Sea"
 pol_pagan_access_the_baltic_sea_desc: "Across the frigid waters of the Baltic Sea lies those who follow their own pantheons, very much similar to ours. Not only that, they are also under threat of Christian crusade under the banner of the Swedish king. Gaining access to the Baltic Sea through the Pomeralian lands will be of major priority if we wish to begin strategic talks with them."
 pol_pagan_naval_security_title: "Naval Security"
 pol_pagan_naval_security_desc: "With Gdansk secured, we have gained a major shipyard to begin constructing a naval fleet. These waters are plagued with raiding parties, and if we do not secure our own waters, our port towns will be the first to suffer, and the first to turn away from us."
 pol_pagan_secure_pomerania_title: "Control Pomerania"
 pol_pagan_secure_pomerania_desc: "Between us and our brothers in faith, the Wends, lies the Pomeranian people. Though they still follow the rule of Perun, there are many that have turned away to the Cross, no doubt under the pressure of missionaries from the neighbouring Baltic trade cities. If we are to unite our brothers, we will need to control this intermediary."
 pol_pagan_wendia_title: "Union with the Wends"
 pol_pagan_wendia_desc: "The Wendish people are undoubtedly the most resilient people in Europe. Pressed on all sides, they have resisted subjugation for centuries by heretics and heathens alike. The High Priest of Veleti is the spiritual leader of the Slavic faith, and any threat to them is a threat to us. A union with the Wends will be a blessing to both of our people and faith as one."
 pol_pagan_reconvert_moravia_title: "Reconvert Moravia"
 pol_pagan_reconvert_moravia_desc: "The once great Moravian empire spanned much of the West Slavs, including our own people. The first to convert away from the Slavic faith almost eons ago, The Moravian people are one of the most devout Christian believers in Eastern Europe. If we ever wish to assimilate them into our kingdom, we will need to reignite the flames of Perun upon the temple walls."
 pol_pagan_tame_the_czech_lion_title: "Tame the Czech Lion"
 pol_pagan_tame_the_czech_lion_desc: "The Czech people have withstood much turmoil and persevered through bitter war. No matter their faith, the exploits of the legendary Hussite general Jan Zizka earned the respect of all Slavs. Alienated by the Emperor and his ilk after the terrors of the Hussite Wars, there is a small opportunity for us to tame the Czech Lion."
 pol_pagan_invade_ruthenia_title: "Invade Ruthenia"
 pol_pagan_invade_ruthenia_desc: "The Ruthenian princes lie squabbling amongst themselves, all vying to claim the legacy of the once splendrous Kievan Rus'. Without unity, they are open to conquest, and the reclaiming of Kyiv will be imperative to reaffirm the Slavic faith throughout Eastern Europe."
 pol_pagan_proclaim_great_lechia_title: "Wielka Lechia"
 pol_pagan_proclaim_great_lechia_desc: "The name of Great Lechia echoes throughout Europe. Our banners soar from the North Sea to the Baltic Sea, from the holy Sleza to the Black Sea. A union of many cultures, from the remains of the Great Moravians and the Kievan Rus', the rising Intermarium is a blend of many legacies once past! Under our wonderous rule, the proclamation of the Wielka Lechia will signal the dawn of the Lechitic Empire!"
 pol_pagan_pruthenia_title: "Seize Pruthenia"
 pol_pagan_pruthenia_desc: "The Pruthenian people share close ties with our own, in both culture and Old God belief. Ruled by diplomatic tribal chiefs and kings but resistant to influence, recent religious turmoil in the Holy Roman Empire has exiled zealots to the fringes of Christendom, least of all the trade cities of Gdansk and Riga. Seizing Pruthenia for ourselves will prevent the Amber Road from falling into the hands of the greedy Hanseatic League."
 pol_pagan_subjugate_lithuania_title: "Lithuanian Subjugation"
 pol_pagan_subjugate_lithuania_desc: "The Lithuanians are the most powerful of the Baltic chiefdoms, having amassed a significant realm through diplomacy and war alike. Though respect can be given to their independence they are but a mere roadblock in our campaign to restore the prosperity of the Amber Road. They will not tolerate our beliefs nor willingly bow to our kings. The Lithuanians must be brought to heel!"
 pol_pagan_amber_road_title: "Expand the Amber Road"
 pol_pagan_amber_road_desc: "With the fracturing of beliefs away from the Old Gods and conflict between petty issues, much of the Amber Road has been left to decay and fallen into disuse. The seizure of Pruthenia has linked the northern terminus of the Amber Road with the central trade outposts in Poland under a single kingdom, ensuring lucrative trade profits for the realm if we deign to restore and expand the routes."
 pol_pagan_baltoslavic_union_title: "Balto-Slavic Union"
 pol_pagan_baltoslavic_union_desc: "As the last of the Estonian and Livonian banners fall, replaced with the great eagle of Lechia, the Baltic and Slavic people have been united as one! Though we are united in worship of the Old Gods, those of the Romuvan faith deign not to turn to Perun. If we are to maintain peace with the Baltic people, we must reconciliate our beliefs and respect their faith."
 pol_pagan_native_faith_church_title: "Church of the Native Faith"
 pol_pagan_native_faith_church_desc: "The churches of the Slavic faith are meagre homesteads compared to the lavish Christian cathedrals. It should come to no surprise that wayward believers can be fooled into thinking the Christian priesthood would share such wealth. As such,the rejuvenation of church land of our native faith should be a focus of the regime if we wish to strengthen the belief in Perun."
 pol_pagan_breadbasket_europe_title: "Breadbasket of Europe"
 pol_pagan_breadbasket_europe_desc: "The lands of Poland and south-western Ruthenia has always been the breadbasket of Europe, feeding those from Holland to Neva. With the ever looming threat of the Golden Horde, the Kievan granaries have been preserved for their own use in defense against the Mongol successors. As such, we remain the only plentiful source of grain in the region. If we do not sufficiently feed the people, they will look to take it for themselves..."
 pol_pagan_develop_countryside_title: "Develop the Countryside"
 pol_pagan_develop_countryside_desc: "Our lands have been battered, razed and dishevelled over the long centuries. It is nigh time that our people, our humble farmers and builders, know good fortune. Prosperity is within our reach, so long as we reach for it!"
 pol_pagan_support_mercantile_class_title: "Support the Merchants"
 pol_pagan_support_mercantile_class_desc: "We stand at a crossroads of trade. To the west, vile Christian Europe booms with prosperity and new innovations. To the east, riches and fantastical commodities flow from the mysterious reaches of the Silk Road. It is only right that we capitalise upon our position and enable both locals and strangers alike to do their business!"
 pol_pagan_urbanize_poland_title: "Urbanize Poland"
 pol_pagan_urbanize_poland_desc: "Battered as we are, we are resurgent. Our people are enjoying new heights of wealth, stability and prosperity, the likes of which many have never experienced before. We must capitalise on this new growth and burgeoning wealth - new cities, new urban centres, new localities, must rise from the ashes and become shining examples!"
 pol_pagan_splendor_of_capital_title: "Splendor of [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 pol_pagan_splendor_of_capital_desc: "It is only right that [Root.Capital.GetName] stands alongside the beautiful metropolises of history! From Vilnius to Barlin, many capitals have shone and will continue to do so. It is only fitting that [Root.Capital.GetName] is among them and towers above all else!"
 pol_pagan_royal_palace_title: "Royal Palace"
 pol_pagan_royal_palace_desc: "Deep in [Root.Capital.GetName], our rulers conspire and plot for the betterment of our people, of the good bountiful Gods and of the savage warriors of the faith. With all our new wealth and resources, we can afford to make for ourselves a fitting palace that will draw the envy of the world."
 pol_pagan_increase_the_production_title: "Increase the Production"
 pol_pagan_increase_the_production_desc: "We would be fools not to capitalise upon the great plethora of goods within our very borders! Our land is fertile, our people are willing and our work ethic undeniable."
 pol_pagan_invest_in_manufactories_title: "Invest in Manufactories"
 pol_pagan_invest_in_manufactories_desc: "To keep up with the rest of Europe, we must forge ahead and establish bountiful manufactories across our realm. We must increase our means of industry tenfold if we hope to compete with our enemies!"
 pol_pagan_heavy_industry_title: "Polish Heavy Industry"
 pol_pagan_heavy_industry_desc: "Owing to the size and wealth of our realm, we have the opportunity to become an industrial powerhouse! Our expansive country, should we divert enough resources towards its industry, could rise above the rival powers of Europe and become a mighty producer of everything imaginable! When one thinks of the word 'industry', they shall think first of the Vistulans!"
 pol_pagan_wieliczka_title: "Wieliczka Salt Mine"
 pol_pagan_wieliczka_desc: "Deep beneath Krakow, the sprawling mines of Wieliczka lay waiting. Their potential is vast, untapped. Should we divert resources towards upgrading the mine's capacity, ensuring worker safety and optimal salt refinement, we could make of the mine a treasure trove, the likes of which will put competitors across Europe out of business." 
 pol_pagan_counterbalance_geography_title: "Outweigh Our Geography"
 pol_pagan_counterbalance_geography_desc: "Although the Old Gods have blessed us in many regards, they have certainly not blessed us when it comes to the geography of our nation. Its mostly flatland terrain is susceptible to being easily invaded, and we must counterbalance this harsh reality by fortifying ourselves."

# Missions (Orthodox) #
 pol_orthodox_rally_behind_the_cross_title: "Rally Behind the Cross"
 pol_orthodox_rally_behind_the_cross_desc: "We are followers of the Lord and the Lord only. Surrounded by pagan and hostile entitites we must rally our men behind the cross to become a beacon of orthodox Christianity in this land."
 pol_orthodox_sway_the_piasts_title: "Sway the Piasts"
 pol_orthodox_sway_the_piasts_desc: "Pure military prowess might be unable to deliver us to victory. We should attempt to persuade the influential and prestigious House of Piasts to support our cause."
 pol_orthodox_purge_pagan_heathens_title: "Purge Pagan Heathens"
 pol_orthodox_purge_pagan_heathens_desc: "We have visions of a united Poland, yet unfortunately we are surrounded by pagans of our brethren and not alike, they must be purged for our vision to be complete."
 pol_orthodox_sons_of_lech_title: "Unite the Sons of Lech"
 pol_orthodox_sons_of_lech_desc: "Finally, it is time for the once desparate tribes of our people to unite. This is merely the first step to greatness as our state will continue to prosper."
 pol_orthodox_lendia_title: "The Birth of Lendia"
 pol_orthodox_lendia_desc: "As we turn our attention down towards the southern reaches of the Polish tribal regions, we shall subjugate the traditional Lendian regions and convert them to our faith so that they will become an integral part of our nation."
 pol_orthodox_heart_of_rus_title: "Claim the Heart of Rus'"
 pol_orthodox_heart_of_rus_desc: "Despite being our brothers in faith, the people of the Rus are divided and threatened by the Tatar yoke. We must stabilize the region by laying claim to their lands."

 pol_orthodox_advance_into_ruthenia_desc: "As our army marches through the plains of Ruthenia, neither resistance nor attrition could stop our advance. Ruthenia will be ours."
 pol_orthodox_unite_ruthenia_title: "Heirs of Ruthenia"
 pol_orthodox_unite_ruthenia_desc: "As we have rounded up our conquest of the Ruthenian regions we are now worthy of calling ourselves the true heirs of Ruthenia."
 pol_orthodox_breadbasket_europe_title: "Breadbasket of Europe"
 pol_orthodox_breadbasket_europe_desc: "Let us continue further eastwards in our conquest, further south of Ruthenia is a region that has long been known as the breadbasket of Europe, ownership of this region would be a boon to our prosperity."
 pol_orthodox_mother_of_cities_title: "The Mother of Cities"
 pol_orthodox_mother_of_cities_desc: "This might be the most prestigious of our conquests yet, the mother of all cities Constantinople. The seat of Roman power and influence. Its conquest shall reward us with further glory and fame."
 pol_orthodox_novgorod_the_great_title: "Novgorod the Great"
 pol_orthodox_novgorod_the_great_desc: "To our north lies the region known as Novgorod. Its connection to the Baltic trade path as well as its potential of granting us access to Scandinavia through a lang route makes it a worthy target of conquest."
 pol_orthodox_dethrone_the_borjigins_title: "Dethrone the Borjigins"
 pol_orthodox_dethrone_the_borjigins_desc: "The Mongolian plague that has stained Europe for centuries will now finally come to an end. The scions of the Borjigins will be dethroned and their lands will be ours."
 pol_orthodox_cossacks_title: "Recruit the Cossacks"
 pol_orthodox_cossacks_desc: "The Cossacks are a people native to the steppe regions of Eurasia and are known to be a formidable fighting force. We should recruit them to bolster our ranks."
 pol_orthodox_tsar_of_rus_title: "Car Calej Rusi"
 pol_orthodox_tsar_of_rus_desc: "Having solidified our foothold in Russia, it is only appropriate that we lay claim to its entirety! We must announce to the Russian world that we are the hegemon that will defend them from encroachment. We are the rulers of Russia, protectors of the east!"
 pol_orthodox_unite_with_moravia_title: "Unite with Moravia"
 pol_orthodox_unite_with_moravia_desc: "The Moravians have long been a persitent rabble - fighting valiantly, admirably, for their place on the world stage, defending themselves against heretics and heathens alike, forging for themselves, on occasion, empires of their own. Today, they stand beaten and battered, ready to be subsumed by a greater power - namely, us." 
 pol_orthodox_tame_the_czech_lion_title: "Tame the Czech Lion"
 pol_orthodox_tame_the_czech_lion_desc: "Mighty Bohemia, a similarly admirable power, stands vulnerable. Religious infighting has fractured the country for long enough, as well as squabbles with the Catholics to the west and heathens to the north. They would do well beneath our banner - a loyal and ferocious subject to our crown!"
 pol_orthodox_encroach_on_the_empire_title: "Encroach on the Empire"
 pol_orthodox_encroach_on_the_empire_desc: "The bumbling and confused masses of the Holy Roman Empire stand vulnerable. With enough hammer blows, perhaps the entire system could fall apart - or, at the very least, come to acknowledge the error of their ways and see the light of Eastern Orthodoxy, however reluctant they may prove! The time has come for us to encroach upon the false empire."
 pol_orthodox_seek_religious_support_title: "Seek Religious Support"
 pol_orthodox_seek_religious_support_desc: "The current state of our political extent is laughable at best. If we were to encompass more adjacent lands - good Orthodox Christians, Polish or otherwise - we could call upon their loyal ranks and empower our tested and learned clergy with their blood and iron!"
 pol_orthodox_revise_polish_cyrillic_title: "Revise Polish Cyrillic"
 pol_orthodox_revise_polish_cyrillic_desc: "We belong firmly to the eastern wing of Christianity. Hence, we read and write in the intricate Cyrillic script.

 pol_orthodox_polish_patriarchate_title: "Patriarchate of Lendia"
 pol_orthodox_polish_patriarchate_desc: "Having secured and converted all of Poland to the good faith, we must expand our holdings and religious sway until it is undeniable to the Orthodox world that we, the good Lends, are a patriarchate in our own right, tantamount to the Greeks of old, the Rus, the Bulgarians and those lost of the distant Levant."
 pol_orthodox_ecclesiastical_architecture_title: "Ecclesiastical Architecture"
 pol_orthodox_ecclesiastical_architecture_desc: "Devout followers of the true faith we are, it is only appropriate that we decorate our realm accordingly! In every town, every locality, there must be towering spires dedicated to the almighty! Our people must know the glory of God."
 pol_orthodox_unity_by_faith_title: "Unity by Faith"

 pol_orthodox_secure_pomerania_title: "Secure Pomerania"
 pol_orthodox_secure_pomerania_desc: "Pomerania has, for centuries, eluded subjugation and Christianisation. Attempts have been made, crusades have failed - now, they will face our wrath. Where the Catholics have failed, we shall succeed - Pomerania will fall to our relentless march west. Their wealth, their souls, their iron, shall be ours."
 pol_orthodox_subjugate_the_wends_title: "Subjugate the Wends"
 pol_orthodox_subjugate_the_wends_desc: "The Wends have been a persistent thorn in the side of the Catholic Germans for some time now. We must applaud them for this. Surely they would do well under our banners, following the true faith, knowing the word as it is meant to be taught. It is nigh time we amend their ways, before the Germans get to it before we do!"
 pol_orthodox_access_the_baltic_sea_title: "Access the Baltic Sea"
 pol_orthodox_access_the_baltic_sea_desc: "To the north, the stubborn Pruthenians hide in their tangled forests and whimsical marshes, biding their time. We must rout them out and cast their hideous ways to the dirt! Should we sufficiently crush them, we could use their land as a stepping stone to the Baltic Sea and all its riches and opportunities..."
 pol_orthodox_subjugate_lithuania_title: "Subjugate Lithuania"
 pol_orthodox_subjugate_lithuania_desc: "The Lithuanians, fearsome and respectable, must know the light of Christ. Should they be allowed to fester further, they may pose an existential threat and their wicked heathen ways may embolden them to strike out at the world, similar to the treacherous faraway Norsemen. They would do well as our subjects!"
 pol_orthodox_baltic_security_title: "Baltic Security"
 pol_orthodox_baltic_security_desc: "Having established an ample foothold over the Pruthenians and the Lithuanians, we must complete our northern efforts. The Baltics must render unto us.

 pol_orthodox_counterbalance_geography_title: "Outweigh Our Geography"
 pol_orthodox_counterbalance_geography_desc: "We are vulnerable, unfortunately, to outside encroachment, owing to the flatness of our geography. From the east, Tatars have frequently come roaring, roaming like foul beasts across our vulnerable borders. From the north, Norsemen have come marauding at will via the rivers. From the west, unspeakable horrors. We must fortify the realm accordingly!"

# Missions (Catholic) #
 pol_catholic_crush_the_lendians_title: "Crush the Lendians"
 pol_catholic_crush_the_lendians_desc: "The Lendians have acted in an impotent and impetulant manner for far too long. Though they have grown somewhat civilised over time, they have been led estray by the Rus to the east - following the lies of the Eastern Church as opposed to the wisdom of the Pope. We must correct this error!"
 pol_catholic_warriors_of_christendom_title: "Warriors of Christendom"
 pol_catholic_warriors_of_christendom_desc: "Surrounded on all sides by barbaric heathens, misled heretics and hungry warmongers, we stand as an isolated bastion of the one true faith, of enlightened loyalty to the Pope. Descendents of the first and only king of all Poland, Mieszko, we bitterly struggle to preserve his lineage and spread the word of his faith. Perhaps soon, our fate shall be decided!"
 pol_catholic_purge_pagan_heathens_title: "Purge Pagan Heathens"
 pol_catholic_purge_pagan_heathens_desc: "Emboldened and energised, our armies rear for combat! To the east, hordes of heathens lay in wait, rearing their fangs, eager to descend upon our fledgling realm and rob us of our beloved Christ. We must strike out at them first - and bring them the word of God!"
 pol_catholic_subjugate_the_wends_title: "Baptize Wendia"
 pol_catholic_subjugate_the_wends_desc: "The Wends, ferocious and persistent, refuse to see reason. The Germans to the west have failed in correcting their ways and the Swedish crusaders to the north have seemingly become preoccupied with the Norse. Thus, the duty falls on our shoulders. Baptise the Wends!"

 pol_catholic_secure_pomerania_desc: "Foolishly, the Pomeranians persist in their heathen ways, feasting off the coin from Baltic trade and occasional alliances to the west. It seems they will only see reason so long as it is spoken by the sword. No matter - God is with us!"
 pol_catholic_sons_of_lech_title: "Unite the Sons of Lech"
 pol_catholic_sons_of_lech_desc: "Many centuries ago, Meiszko wisely pledged fealty to the Pope and the word of the Catholic Church. Almost immediately, the warlike chieftains beneath him rebelled - thus, we Sons of Lech have laid in a disunited state ever since. This cannot continue - if we are to make our mark on history, we must unite under one banner, one cross, one God!"
 pol_catholic_mater_polonia_title: "Gaude Mater Polonia"
 pol_catholic_mater_polonia_desc: "All of Poland is at last falling before our sword. The petty tribes, warlords, princes and bandits whom have reduced our homeland to ashes are at last meeting their ends - or, as is right, become loyal men of Christ. Before long, we will be Poland once again!"
 pol_catholic_control_the_electors_title: "Control the Electors"
 pol_catholic_control_the_electors_desc: "Having crushed the Pomeranians and subjected the Wends, having brought the light of God to the unholy heathen wastes, having carved for ourselves an empire out of the ancient woodlands and frozen marshes... we have shown the world what we are ready to do in defence of good Catholic civilisation. We have singlehandedly eradicated the great Wendish threat to the Holy Roman Empire. Now, they have no choice but to accept us as their protectors!"
 pol_catholic_imperial_ascendancy_title: "Imperial Ascendancy"
 pol_catholic_imperial_ascendancy_desc: "Imperial ascendancy would guarantee for us the wealth, resources, recognition and devotion of all the Holy Roman Empire. It is only right - we have defended it from certain destruction and we seem most qualified for the position."
 pol_catholic_access_the_baltic_sea_title: "Access the Baltic Sea"
 pol_catholic_access_the_baltic_sea_desc: "The vile Pruthenian pagans are content with their backwards tribe and worship of false gods. Not only that, they sit at the crossroads of many passing merchants and caravans, and ships sailing throughout the Baltic Sea, while threatening the existence of Danzig. It is our moral prerogative to not only crush the Pruthenians and drive their heathenous faith into extinction, but to safeguard the German Catholics and place them within our protective hands. They will do much better under the holy guidance of Poland, all the safer and wealthier for it."
 pol_catholic_embellish_gdansk_title: "Embellish Gdansk"
 pol_catholic_embellish_gdansk_desc: "In just a short time, Danzig - now Gdansk, as it should be - has grown from a noticeable and important port town into a bustling metropolis, brimming with vibrant trade and goods coming in and out daily. God intended for us to raise this city of stone and turn it into polished marble, and acting in accordance to His will, exactly that has been done. Now and forevermore, let the city of Gdansk be the capital of the Baltic Sea, glorious and prosperous for all to see!"
 pol_catholic_reconvert_moravia_title: "Reconvert Moravia"
 pol_catholic_reconvert_moravia_desc: "It is a tragic thing that our Orthodox brothers have taken the path of heresy. To forsake the temporal authority of the Pope in Rome is no easy decision, yet it paves the way for Christendom's fall, and for immorality to take root in society, as the enemies of God are many, and one cannot afford even more divison.\n\n... But that is alright. The Moravian Christians, for as rigorous as they believe their faith in the Orthodox Church to be, will soon understand the error of their ways, and the plight and suffering they bring by their stubborn refusal to bend the knee to the Pope. Such a revelation will quickly push them back towards the true light."
 pol_catholic_wenceslas_title: "Crown of Saint Wenceslas"
 pol_catholic_wenceslas_desc: "The Czechs are a troubled, confused, and lost people. They have struggled with their identity against the influence of German culture and politics that have forced them to concede time and time again, crawling back for their protection against the Magyars, the Moravians, and even our own, sadly pagan, brothers. The last in this long line of tragedies has been the Hussite movement, yet another call of devilry and heresy that wishes to split and fracture Christ's followers so that the enemy may have an easier time destroying us. This will not stand, and we will certainly not let it continue. Whether the Crown of Bohemia will be an equal in our kingdom, or a part of our dominion, it matters not - the Lion's Throne will be secured, and our Czech brothers saved from sin."
 pol_catholic_advance_into_ruthenia_title: "Advance into Ruthenia"
 pol_catholic_advance_into_ruthenia_desc: "It is Poland's fate not only to unify her own people, and drive out the heathens of the north, but to look east and gaze upon the sea of lost men. The sons of Rus know not what they do, struggling to find their faith as all around them they are assailed by murderous pagans and strange, alluring, yet evil faiths. Their insistence of isolating themselves from Catholic Europe will be their downfall, and it is only our intervention that can stop such an egregious act. They may yet see the truth."
 pol_catholic_subjugate_lithuania_title: "Subjugate Lithuania"
 pol_catholic_subjugate_lithuania_desc: "The dukes of Lithuania have time and time again refused to look towards the infinite mercy of God and accept the teachings of Christ into their hearts. Instead, they would rather wallow for eternity, doomed to irrelevance and the hellfire that awaits them in the next life. Their sad display has forced us to act - we know how easily the Pruthenians were swayed by our honeyed words, and just the same will happen to the Lithuanians. Once their lands are ours, and their people ours, it will be a short march away before all the Baltics have been liberated from Romuvan paganism."
 pol_catholic_baltic_security_title: "Baltic Security"
 pol_catholic_baltic_security_desc: "The deed is done. The Baltic is ours now, and all of its people with it. They may not speak our language, and at first wish to even be ruled by us, but in time they will understand the severity of their own plight, and will thank us for our kindness in saving their souls from damnation. Conveniently, beyond the extensive benefits this gives us in our mercantile matters, it serves as a staging grounds for an invasion into the lands of Novgorod, and such an opportunity will not be wasted. To arms!"
 pol_catholic_heart_of_rus_title: "Claim the Heart of Rus'"
 pol_catholic_heart_of_rus_desc: "Kyiv - the Mother of Cities, the beating heart of Rus' culture, the Patriarch's stronghold. Were we to take this, tear down the Orthodox iconography and enrich it with the glory of Catholic artwork, then we would be able to strike a blow to the legitimacy of the many Orthodox churches. After all, if we can turn the Rus to our side of salvation and mercy, and establish a new, Polish-dominant empire in these vast lands, then Catholicism will be unstoppable."
 pol_catholic_forge_the_intermarium_title: "Forge the Intermarium"
 pol_catholic_forge_the_intermarium_desc: "The Międzymorze is a bold and ambitious plan to unite much of Eastern Europe under our noble rule. From the shores of Danzig to the steppes of Sarai, the chilly ports of the Baltic to the Black Sea, uniting us with our brothers and liberating them from their false worship. With this power in our hands, Poland shall become the most powerful Catholic monarchy to grace the fertile lands of Europe, surpassing even the legendary Merovingians and Carolingians after the fall of ancient Rome, in God's name!"
 pol_catholic_breadbasket_europe_title: "Breadbasket of Europe"
 pol_catholic_breadbasket_europe_desc: "We are both blessed and cursed with our ancestral homelands. Cursed, for there is hardly much to defend when most of your lands are flat plains, or rolling hills at worst. Blessed, for in Poland and in Ruthenia we possess the richest soil in all of Europe, and in taking advantage of this, our population can boom, alongside bringing in a large source of extra revenue for the monarch in our eternal quest to sanctify our part of Europe. No follower of Christ will go without their bread, for what is a monarch's duty if not to relieve his subjects of the pains of earthly life?"
 pol_catholic_mother_of_cities_title: "The Mother of Cities"
 pol_catholic_mother_of_cities_desc: "It comes as a surprise to none that the city of Kyiv has flourished under our control. The hustle and bustle of everyday activity can be heard in the streets as the city stands in the center of many different trade routes, thus naturally enriching it in the process. Not only that, however: we have turned the Lavra monastery into a proper Catholic church, and in time, the Ruthenians, though they may bicker and pointlessly argue at first, will soon understand the fruits of our labor, and the infinite mercy and love that Christ has offered them."
 pol_pagan_invent_vodka_title: "Invent Vodka"
 pol_pagan_invent_vodka_desc: "Ah, wódka. It is a drink for the common man, one that can soothe the spirit, bring about happiness, increase fertility, and awaken one's lust... or so it is claimed, anyway. Nevertheless, as our grain production heightens and our lands become larger, it is becoming more and more of an appealing idea to tap into this new market. The merchants certainly clamor for it, citing that it will increase the happiness of our people and enrich the country's coffers. It may not necessarily be the most holy idea, but... drink up!"

 pol_orthodox_polish_renaissance_desc: "The Italian peninsula has always enjoyed a deep, profound development of culture in all forms, from poetry to art, to the scientific fields such as mathematics and alchemy. It is no surprise, then, to hear about this so-called 'Renaissance', a rebirth and revival of these fields in all their full glory. Let these wise ideas spread to our kingdom, as we know that there is strength in knowledge and the ability of geniuses, 'polymaths', to revolutionize the way we see the world work. And though these may come from the narrow-minded Catholics, even they can produce something worth considering."

 pol_orthodox_fund_theological_studies_title: "Fund Church Schools"
 pol_orthodox_fund_theological_studies_desc: "What use is a population that does not know its own rites, cannot read their own holy books, cannot even begin to understand their own faith? Such a profound lack of knowledge can only lead to one thing, and that is heresy. With the rise of large academies and a more structured form of education for at the very least those more well-off, let us build a slew of universities across our many different cities, enlightening the people to their own faith, and in turn, teaching them our proud history."
 pol_catholic_fund_theological_studies_title: "Fund Church Schools"
 pol_catholic_fund_theological_studies_desc: "What we hear every now and then from outside the largest cities are shocking. Some priests cannot read the Holy Book and have merely passed it down orally from their predecessors. As well as that, the majority of our population cannot read Latin, and in turn cannot appreciate the full, unlimited wisdom of the Bible. This is a problem that demands immediate reconciliation. Catholic universities, led by well-educated priests and bishops, will further many different causes at once, ranging from teaching the people how to read, to finding ways to further our knowledge of the world God has given to us."
 pol_catholic_increase_the_production_title: "Increase the Production"
 pol_catholic_increase_the_production_desc: "Artisans and the like clamor for help from the monarch in order to better produce their goods. We should offer them aid and coin and spare no efforts in constructing workshops where they can make their product with far more efficiency than before. It will not only benefit them, but us as well in the long term, and certainly boost the already-respectable cloth industry in Gniezno."
 pol_catholic_wieliczka_title: "Wieliczka Salt Mine"
 pol_catholic_wieliczka_desc: "Salt! Is there no greater, more valuable thing in all of Europe, nay, perhaps the world? It is the thing that allows one to preserve their food, help tend to their wounds, and when all is said and done, add quite a nice flavor to whatever meal one has at the time. The mine in Wieliczka is worth its weight in gold, and indeed, were we to take advantage of this, it could bring in vast amounts of revenue for the monarch to take full advantage of."
 pol_catholic_heavy_industry_title: "Polish Heavy Industry"
 pol_catholic_heavy_industry_desc: "Let the churning of goods roar, as Europe watches us ascend! While they are busy squabbling, we are taking advantage of the vast amounts of resources given to us. Textiles, metals, gems, and large supplies of grain and livestock. The wealth gathered from all of this shall be immense indeed, and when dawn breaks over Europe again, it will be Poland who stands as the richest, most advanced empire of all."
 pol_catholic_invest_in_manufactories_title: "Invest in Manufactories"
 pol_catholic_invest_in_manufactories_desc: "Over time, the methods of creating goods and shepherding livestock has advanced and transformed. No longer is it singular, solitary artisans working at a meagre pace and outputting only barely enough to trade and make end's meet. Now these same artisans, alongside farmers and other labourers, can be gathered and made to work together, their efficiency far surpassing what had existed before. These manufactories will be the lifeblood of Poland, and one would be a fool not to take advantage of them."
 pol_catholic_counterbalance_geography_title: "Outweigh Our Geography"
 pol_catholic_counterbalance_geography_desc: "Though we pray for the grace and mercy of God, and thank Him for creating us and allowing us to roam the Earth, some heretics whisper in bitter tongues that God has played a cosmic joke on us by providing us with no natural defenses. This is a lie, as God would never forsake His children. There is a tiny sliver of truth, however, in that we are relatively exposed compared to the other major powers of Europe. The only thing we can do, then, is build our forts well and make them sturdy and strong, alongside keeping an army ready to defend Poland at a moment's notice. Only when we know that we are impregnable can we rest."
 pol_catholic_develop_countryside_title: "Develop the Countryside"
 pol_catholic_develop_countryside_desc: "The sons of Lech deserve rest and recuperation. Our people have been through much, suffered through much, and have been cast aside due to our declaration of faith in the one true God. The people of our homelands deserve better, and they will be given just that. When night falls, a peasant will not worry if his family survives the coming winter - nay, he should pray to God that our victory is swift, and inevitable."
 pol_catholic_support_mercantile_class_title: "Support the Merchants"
 pol_catholic_support_mercantile_class_desc: "We stand between Christian Europe in the west and pagans in the east. In spite of all of this, trade will do as trade does, and continue no matter the circumstances, regardless of politics or faith. These merchants wish to be able to spend and gather their coin at their leisure, and take advantage of the fact that we sit on a large source of wealth. The merchants will not only be allowed to do this, nay, they will be encouraged to do so, bringing goods through the Tatar lands and all the way from Asia, to the rich goods of England. We can only benefit from it."
 pol_catholic_hel_title: "Highway to Hel"
 pol_catholic_hel_desc: "Unlike what was left behind in the collapse of the Roman Empire, we have practically nothing at all. Certainly roads exist, but they carved by feet and not by the hands of working men. If anyone wishes to get anywhere, often times they have to simply take a path that has not been charted at all, leading to a variety of issues. New paths will be dug up, allowing caravans to travel with much less issue and friction, which will let internal trade prosper more easily. Lastly, a series of roads will be made for Danzig, as it has quickly become one of our most important cities, and for good reason."
 pol_catholic_urbanize_poland_title: "Urbanize Poland"
 pol_catholic_urbanize_poland_desc: "The lands are healing from the scars of war, and our people can finally breathe after so long. This is not an incentive to stop here, however, as we cannot allow ourselves to go back to the status quo of scattered villages and tiny towns. Nay, now that prosperity is within sight, our villages, towns and cities will not only bounce back but grow stronger, becoming interconnected and urbanized. Let us raise great settlements akin to the sprawls of Rome!"

 pol_catholic_splendor_of_capital_desc: "A worthy kingdom deserves an equally worthy capital, and [Root.Capital.GetName] will become the center of Polish culture and art. With paved roads and open stalls, workshops and plentiful houses of God, [Root.Capital.GetName] will one day see itself as not merely on par with the urban centers such as Paris, but go above and beyond them. The spirit of the sons of Lech demand only the greatest!"
 pol_catholic_royal_palace_title: "Royal Palace"
 pol_catholic_royal_palace_desc: "At last, [Root.Capital.GetName] has become the object of the world's desire, similar to the ancient city of Constantinople! Hundreds of thousands of our loyal subjects reside in our royal capital, toiling under the ever watchful eye of the monarch. A great palace shall be constructed in [Root.Capital.GetName], not only to centralize all the various offices and duties of the realm, but also to serve as an example of how far we have come from our humble beginnings when we first baptized ourselves in holy faith. Praise God!"
 pol_catholic_seek_religious_support_title: "Seek Religious Support"
 pol_catholic_seek_religious_support_desc: "The lands of eastern Europe are a cold and dreary place, overrun with pagans and heretics who have lost their way. Some despair at our circumstances, wondering if we are truly fit to be Christ's soldiers. This fear must be crushed, however, and replaced with a fervent desire to fight in the name of truth and mercy. Let us empower the clergy, and spread the good word in our lands. For God is on our side, and the Pope will give us his blessing in our struggle!"
 pol_catholic_pope_title: "Papiez Polak"
 pol_catholic_pope_desc: "Our cardinal has been elected to become the next Pope! This is wonderful and incredible news, and shows our loyalty to the Roman church as well as our dutiful faith. This new Pope - our Pope! - will greatly increase our standing with the rest of the Catholic world, and in turn, reinforce in our populace the certainty that we are following the righteous path. Amen!"
 pol_catholic_unity_by_faith_title: "Unity by Faith"
 pol_catholic_unity_by_faith_desc: "Today is a truly holy day! Today we can mark that we, sons of Lech, heirs of Mieszko, have seen the path to the Kingdom of Heaven. God be praised! Though it is tragic that for so long many of our Polish brothers and sisters have been lost, we can now say - never again! Never again will we be tempted with heresy, nor pulled into heathenous, barbaric beliefs! Perun lies rotting in his grave, alongside the rest of his false idols, as only God Almighty chooses where the thunder of judgement strikes!"
 pol_catholic_bulwark_of_christianity_title: "Bulwark of Christianity"
 pol_catholic_bulwark_of_christianity_desc: "We pious few stand against the tide of ignoble and evil men who wish to pervert our faith and destroy it for their own amusement. It is we who defend Europe from what lies beyond. It is we who are the beacons of light that shine the dark and dreadful path which all followers of Christ must walk! And for our efforts, the Vatican will bless our nation and bestow upon it great privileges and sanctions. Our monarch shall wield the flaming sword of righteousness, and set forth on his white steed, in God's name!"
 pol_catholic_ecclesiastical_architecture_title: "Ecclesiastical Architecture"
 pol_catholic_ecclesiastical_architecture_desc: "Nothing can compare to the sheer beauty and magnifence of Catholic churches and monasteries. We draw upon Roman legacy, their pillars of marble, the mosaics of Italy, the stunning Gothic architecture of Germany, and our own masterful works of art. Taking from all of this and more, we will build beautiful churches that can stand the test of time, and these same churches will show just how glorious our heavenly God is."

 pol_pagan_fall_of_rus_desc: "Oh, sons of Rus, how they have lost their way. The worship of their evil God of their Testaments has led them to fight and kill each other in an endless loop of division and betrayal. This is merely a diversion, however, on our path to a united and greater Lechia. Let us cast aside this 'righteous' faith, and have the Rus' return to normalcy. It is time to gather our axes and shields, and march until we see the White Sea."
 pol_catholic_conquest_of_rus_title: "Conquest of Rus'"
 pol_catholic_conquest_of_rus_desc: "So the last embers of the Kievan Rus flicker and fade until there is nothing left. In its place, rather than the disorganised and frightened remnants, now comes a new purpose - to serve a greater whole, to become a part of the Intermarium led by our dutiful monarch, whose loyalty is only to God, Christ, and the Pope. Let us lay the foolish ambitions of these statelets to rest."

 ukr_first: "Defy the Golden Horde"
 ukr_first_desc: "We were once a divided but proud and prosperous people, but in the wake of the Tartar hordes our once great cities and cathedrals have been reduced to ash and dust. The senseless destruction of our homeland demands to be paid for in blood - and we have long been anticipating the day we might put the lessons we learned from our previous defeats to the test."
 ukr_second: "The Rebirth of Rus'"
 ukr_second_desc: "There has long been a sentiment among the various Rus’ princes to re-unify in the wake of Tartar domination. Now that the various hordes that used to exact tribute from us are too busy fighting amongst themselves to stop us, any prince with a strong enough will can unite the whole of the Rus’ once again - and perhaps even go further."
 ukr_fourth: "Varangian Trade Routes"
 ukr_fourth_desc: "The proud Viking forebears of our dynasty knew the value of the great rivers that flow through this region, but ever since the Tartar invasions, these trade routes have fallen into sharp decline. If we could revitalize these ancient trade routes, there is no doubt we could have a firmer grasp on the trade that flows through this region."
 ukr_third: "Siberian Frontier"
 ukr_third_desc: "The distant wastes of Siberia call to us. We must clear a way there and let our cossacks go forth and bring land for the people of Rus'."
 ukr2_third: "Siberian Frontier"
 ukr2_third_desc: "The distant wastes of Siberia call to us. We must clear a way there and let our cossacks go forth and bring land for the people of Rus'."
 ukr_fifth: "Legacy of Saint Volodymyr"
 ukr_fifth_desc: "Long ago, our forebearer Volodymyr of Novgorod saw the light of Christ Jesus and brought all the Rus’ people under His church. With the Romans who historically held control of the Patriarch gone, there is a vacuum which we could easily fill given the size and strength of our state, and our connection by blood to the great Roman emperors of old. We will consecrate a new Patriarch of all the Rus’ to show all other faithful that we are the inheritors of the holy Orthodox Church."
 ukr_seventh: "Kiev - The Mother of Cities"
 ukr_seventh_desc: "In many ways, Kiev is the root from which all of the other major Rus’ capitals have spawned. Razed and pillaged by the barbarian hordes centuries ago, it is now but a mere shadow of its former self. We must rebuild the city of our ancestors grander and more opulent than ever before, so that all will know the glory of the Rus’ people!"

 rus_vodka: "Monopoly on Vodka"
 rus_streletsky: "Streletsky Prikaz"
 russloboda: "Sloboda Settlements"
 russloboda_desc: "The Sloboda system allows us to encourage the growth of settlements in frontier regions. By granting tax-free status to Sloboda settlements, we can encourage the migration of competent people and aid in the displacement of Tatars in the steppe by Rus settlers."
 rusmestnichestvo: "Mestnichestvo"
 rusmestnichestvo_desc: "The Mestnichestvo represents the hierarchy within the nobility, dictating which families are of the most suitable stock to fill particular government positions. This causes a significant amount of infighting amongst the nobility, ensuring they focus on competing with one another rather than acting in unison against the monarchy and giving us a caste of hereditary bureaucrats."
 rusprikazy: "Prikazy"
 rusprikazy_desc: "The Prikaz is an administrative, judicial, or territorial office that aids in the governance of the state. The Prikazy function as governors of autonomous territories, high-ranking bureaucrats, and military officials, with some even acting as subordinates to the Patriarchy."
 russtreletsky: "Streletsky Prikaz"
 russtreletsky_desc: "The Streletsky Prikaz is the Prikaz (department) in charge of the management of both the Vyborniye and Gorodskiye Streltsy, overseeing the distribution of their salaries and bread allowance, the oversight of their property and the collection of taxes from the Streltsy."
 rustable: "The Table of Ranks"
 rustable_desc: "With the earlier Mestnichestvo system quickly becoming outdated as our state modernizes, a new system, the table of ranks, will be introduced. This reorganizes our bureaucratic, military, and naval ranks to be based on merit rather than one’s heritage, ensuring our government is full of those who are best qualified for a position."
 rusboyarduma: "The Boyar Duma"
 rusboyarduma_desc: "The Boyar are an essential part of the administration of our state, and by giving them an outlet to voice their concerns with the sovereign, we may increase their influence but allow a more regular and stable diet of all of the estates to take place."
 russenate: "The Governing Senate"
 russenate_desc: "By replacing the Boyar Duma with a Governing Senate, we can further erode the power of the estates in opposing the will of the Tsar, ensuring that the unaltered, autocratic vision of our sovereign can be achieved without intervention from meddling lessers."
 rusvodka: "State Vodka Monopoly"

 ruskontsy: "Establish Regional Kontsy"
 ruskontsy_desc: "Within our capital, the city is split into five separate boroughs, known as the Kontsy. These kontsy have special privileges and autonomy from the state, and by allowing other cities to establish themselves as regional boroughs, we can allow a smoother regional administration."
 rustysyatsky: "Tysyatsky"
 rustysyatsky_desc: "By merging the roles of Kniaz and Tysyatsky together, we can ensure that the head of state of our grand republic is a qualified military ruler to call upon in times of hardship, ensuring that the executive branch of government is always held by a strong figure."
 rusvechesupremacy: "Supremacy of the Veche"
 rusvechesupremacy_desc: "While our republic’s head of state remains the Kniaz, the true power is held by the Veche, the city council. The council, being the true power behind the government, allows us to maintain a cheap, expert bureaucracy to rule over our subjects."
 rusconvert: "Convert the Tatars"
 rusconvert_desc: "With the Golden Horde on the decline and the advent of gunpowder making their cavalry far less useful in subjugating the Rus, we can now begin to reverse the tide. It is our divine duty to subjugate the Tatars and show them the light of God."
 rusmetropolitanschools: "Metropolitan Schools"
 rusmetropolitanschools_desc: "By establishing a wide network of schools in our various metropolitans, we can ensure our populace and our theologians are well-educated in matters both worldly and spiritual, rising up the peasantry and instilling religious values into them."

 rus_metropolitan_institution_spread: "Metropolitan Schools"
 rusexpandmissionary: "Expand Missionary Efforts"

 ruscourtprinces: "Court the Princes"
 ruscourtprinces_desc: "Despite being a primarily religious state, it still remains that we have a wide swathe of Rus princes serving as administrators and local leaders. Rather than upending the structure of society to install religious bureaucrats, we could instead partially secularize our administration to include the nobility."
 ruscrushprinces: "Crush the Princes"
 ruscrushprinces_desc: "To make a society that is truly one founded on the basis of religion, the time has come to purge the nobility from our administrative structure."
 rusheadorthodox: "Head of the Orthodox Church"
 rusheadorthodox_desc: "With the growing influence of our church, separate from that of Constantinople, the time has finally come for us to establish a fully independent patriarchy to act as the prime religious head for the faith in our lands."
 rusreligiouscharters: "Religious Charters"
 rusreligiouscharters_desc: "As the patriarchate has expanded into the untamed wilderness of Siberia, the realities of the difficulty in converting those under the rule of our charter companies have begun to set in. To amend this issue, we have now made it compulsory for all trade companies to install religious schools alongside their trading posts, so that the Siberian natives may come to know the light of God."

 principality_vol: "Kingdom of Rus'"
 principality_vol_desc: "This state has a government system that has evolved in the years after the fall of Kiev and under the pressure of constant incursions of Tatar tribute expeditions.

 ab_bogdanoff.1.t: "A Promising Scientist"
 ab_bogdanoff.1.d: "Rumours have caught up wind of the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName], a brilliant scientist, born of [Root.Culture.GetGroupName] and [bogdanoff_host_country.Culture.GetName] noble lineage, recently published multiple articles in prestigious institutions such as the University of Toulouse and the University of Orléans, expanding upon the work of Nicholas of Cusa in the field of astronomy, bringing new light to issues raised by Cardinal Cusa on the nature of the sun, what is the centre of the universe, and the thesis that celestial bodies are not strictly spherical, neither have circular orbits."
 ab_bogdanoff.1.a: "Excellent! bring him to court!"
 ab_bogdanoff.1.b: "We must stick to our own talent, these folk from Rus' don't seem trustworthy"
 ab_bogdanoff.2.t: "The Bogdanoff Affair"
 ab_bogdanoff.2.d: "The worst has come to pass, our hired advisor, Igor Bogdanoff, has recently come under fire from multiple [Root.Culture.GetGroupName] academics, a deeper reading of his recently published papers revealed them to be a word salad with no scientific rigour, written only to stitch together concepts meant to maximise the pre-conceived notions of the University Personnel responsible for checking papers.\n\nThis scandal is currently contained to the Academics of [Root.GetName] but unless we act fast it can spill over and bring serious questions upon [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s best judgment, most of our advisors wish to permanently exile this miscreant back to [bogdanoff_host_country.GetName], while some of our advisors see the potential in a man that fooled prestigious universities, and wish to pay off the academics and re-assign Bogdanoff as a Minister of Propaganda."
 ab_bogdanoff.2.a: "Exile him to [bogdanoff_host_country.GetName]! permanently!"
 ab_bogdanoff.2.b: "Open the chest to make the academics shut up and make him our Minister of Propaganda"

# Events #
 ab_rus.1.t: "The Tatar Yoke"
 ab_rus.1.d: "Our kings were slaves, our soldiers orphans. For two centuries, our cities and our states have been under the firm grip of the hordes on horseback, inhabitants of the great plains and lords of all that they have ravaged. Being degraded from princes among princes to mere tax collectors, some have thrived – many more have perished. However, even in our dire straits, we can see light at the end of the tunnel. Lately, control has slipped farther and farther away from the hands of the unworthy – so far, in fact, that it would take but one decisive blow to break the Tatar yoke."
 ab_rus.1.a: "We shall strike first, and strike hard!"
 ab_rus.2.t: "Select the Country Name"
 ab_rus.2.d: "The formable nation of Rus comes with four different cosmetic names. Pick it to your liking."
 ab_rus.2.a: "We will be known as Ruthenia!"
 ab_rus.2.b: "We will be known as Russia!"
 ab_rus.2.c: "We will be known as Kievan Rus!"
 ab_rus.2.de: "We will be known as Rus!"
 ab_rus.5.t: "The Restoration of Rus"
 ab_rus.5.d: "The tyranny of the Tatar yoke, the rotten wishes of our ancienmost enemies, the malevolent ambitions of a Rome past its prime. The Rus’ have endured and conquered each of these fears, each of these opponents. Our way is clear to become the largest empire known to man, and we must not spoil this golden opportunity. Rejoice, Mother Rus', for your children will be Tsars!"
 ab_rus.5.a: "And the world shall tremble!"
 ab_rus.6.t: "The Birth of Pan-Slavism"
 ab_rus.6.d: "Briefly after our own migration westwards, the Slavs splintered into the many denominations we know today. But a sentiment, as of our most recent victories, is growing in the hearts of each one of us - one of national unity, one of cultural fervour, one of brotherhood. Our state, the most powerful among the children of the very first Slavs, is viewed as the harbinger of a new era, one in which Slavs may live prosper and potent under our hegemony. The Third Rome, it seems, was never a Slavic one, but it was the symbol of this new movement - Pan-Slavism."
 ab_rus.6.a: "Slava Rodu!"
 ab_rus.7.t: "The Destruction of Sarai"
 ab_rus.7.d: "Sarai, stronghold of the Steppes, from whence once Mongolian warlords extorted tribute and persecuted our forefathers, is ours. While the obvious choice would be to sack it, like they would any city of their own conquest, our merchants argue that it could become more useful and prosperous under our hands than it ever was before."
 ab_rus.7.a: "Nay, burn it!"
 ab_rus.7.b: "The Steppes have shed enough blood"
 ab_rus.8.t: "The Patriarchate of All Rus'"
 ab_rus.8.d: "Ever since Saint Olga of Kiev’s conversion, we have successfully evaded the strong influence of the Purple Phoenix in our affairs. With all of Russia under our control, and one Orthodox faith uniting us all, our leadership and emancipation has become clear. In spite of the Ecumenical Patriarch’s vain hopes, for the first time we shall have a united Patriarchate, encompassing all Rus’ and independent of the church of Constantinople."
 ab_rus.8.a: "Hallelujah!"
 ab_rus.9.t: "The Seat of the Tsar"
 ab_rus.9.d: "With both centers of the mighty Kievan Rus' under our firm control, many have been suggesting that in order to further legitimize ourselves as the only true heir of Rus', we should move our seat to either of these ancient cities."
 ab_rus.9.a: "The Mother of Cities shall become our new capital!"
 ab_rus.9.b: "The court will move to the Great Novgorod!"
 ab_rus.9.c: "Nevermind"
 ab_rus.11.t: "Select the Country Color"
 ab_rus.11.d: "The formable nation of Rus comes with the ability to pick the country color."

 vol_convert_rus_title: "Convert Rus'"
 vol_convert_rus_desc: "Let us fulfill the promise we gave to the Pope. We shall create a new, Catholic Ruthenia and the conversion of Kiev, its ancient capital, will be our first triumphant victory."
 ab_shade_khan_title: "In the Shadow of the Khan" 
 ab_shade_khan_desc: "Despite all the hardships mighty Rus has been through, none have been as harsh as the years of domination under the Khans. Their bands of thieves and pillagers demand tribute from all the Sons of Rus. While it is currently impossible for us to overthrow the Khans at the moment, we can still work in the shadows against our neighbours. Once we build up enough power, we will crush the Tatars." 
 ab_tatar_yoke_title: "Break the Tatar Yoke"
 ab_tatar_yoke_desc: "While we have been strengthening our position, the Khanate has been suffering under their own incompetence. Their moment of weakness is the golden opportunity to prove to all other East Slavs that we are the ones who will free them from the Tatars. No more will we bow to the savage nomads in the east!" 
 ab_russia_dismantle_title: "Dethrone the Borjigins" 
 ab_russia_dismantle_desc: "The Golden Horde has for centuries ravaged and pilfered Rus for every ruble it had. Now we take the fight to them. The Cossacks have given their full support for this invasion. We will pillage their lands and drive out their people and replace them with proper Orthodox Slavs." 
 ab_russia_fields_title: "Liberate the Wild Fields" 
 ab_russia_fields_desc: "The plains of Zaporizhia and Yedisan are strongholds of proper Orthodox Ruthenian culture. Cossacks run free and true and actively resist the threat of the Tatars. The wheat fields of those lands also provide bread for the entire region. It is crucial that we secure such a valuable region from our rivals and the Tatars." 
 ab_russia_crimea_title: "Secure Crimea" 
 ab_russia_crimea_desc: "It is quite cold where we live, and the water our state utilises is unfortunately frozen for a decent portion of the year. To remedy this, the Crimean region is our next target for reclamation against the horde. We press onwards to liberate Holy Rus!" 
 ab_russia_consolidate_title: "Consolidate the State" 
 ab_russia_consolidate_desc: "The tumultuous stability of the region means that stability and prosperity are hard to come by. To ensure we do not get swept into the dustbin of history we must do two things. Raise an army to defend our borders, and ensure some semblance of stability for our people. Then we can focus on shattering our rivals." 
 ab_russia_cossacks_title: "Recruit the Cossacks" 
 ab_russia_cossacks_desc: "The Cossacks are proud and mighty people who have proven themselves capable warriors with their horsemanship and tenacity. The biggest threat posed by the hordes is their pesky horse archers who barrage us with arrows without letting our armies get a chance to retaliate. But what if we had our own well trained cavalry to fight back?" 
 ab_russia_game_title: "The Game of Thrones" 
 ab_russia_game_desc: "The Sons of Rus are divided into numerous states and families. Many are descendents of the Rurik that once united all of Rus under their command. The Pinesky family to the south maintains a grip over Ruthenia, and the republic of Novgorod dominates the north. This complicated situation would surely benefit from a few untimely deaths and invasions." 
 ab_russia_dniepr_title: "Control the Dniepr" 
 ab_russia_dniepr_desc: "The Dniepr is one of the most, if not the most important river in all of Rus. The Mongols made a grave mistake by not fully controlling all of it, allowing for numerous powers to split the river. If one nation were to control the most important estuaries of the Dniepr, then their dominance over Ruthenia would be secured. That nation will be us." 
 ab_russia_heirs_title: "Heirs of Ruthenia" 
 ab_russia_heirs_desc: "We have done it. The once shattered Rus has been reforged by the fire in the hearts of our people. The principalities have been united and the Horde is in full retreat. Now it is time to truly claim the title as the true Heir of Ruthenia. We will lead the Slavic world towards a new future under the new Tsar. God Save Rus! God Save the Tsar!" 
 ab_russia_eastern_title: "Eastern Principalities" 
 ab_russia_eastern_desc: "The principalities to the east are the first line of defence against any resurgent Mongol threat. While divided politically, if they were to fall, then all of Rus will fall with them. To ensure that the Mongols will never conquer Rus, we must control these princes ourselves." 
 ab_russia_novgorod_title: "Conquer Novgorod" 
 ab_russia_novgorod_desc: "Novgorod is one of the wealthiest cities to survive the Mongol invasion. Fully securing the city and the surrounding region will provide a great source of wealth to our state and give us a decent hold over the north not just politically but also economically."
 ab_rus_black_sea_fleet_title: "Chernomorsky Flot" 
 ab_rus_black_sea_fleet_desc: "With our liberation of Crimea we now have access to the Black Sea. Unfortunately, there are numerous powers that have strict control over it. Constructing a navy to wrestle control of the Black Sea will grant us a monopoly on its trade and a route to the most holy city of Constantinople" 
 ab_rus_sevastopol_title: "Found Sevastopol" 
 ab_rus_sevastopol_desc: "Now that we control a portion of the Black Sea, we need a proper base of operations and dockyard for our fleet. There is an excellent location with a natural harbour we can use, we just need some of our people to settle it." 
 ab_rus_tsargrad_title: "Claim Tsargrad" 
 ab_rus_tsargrad_desc: "The holy city of Constantinople has fallen from grace over the past few centuries of Angelid rule. The Basileus has clearly failed to properly hold the mantle of Christendom, it is time for the Tsar to take the mantle. The city will now be christened Tsargrad, a city fit for our holy Tsar!" 
 ab_rus_restoration_title: "Imperial Restoration"
 ab_rus_restoration_desc: "We have reconquered the lands once owned by the Second Rome, and while they have faded from history, there exists a movement amongst the clergy to restore the former empire and titles under a personal union. The Tsar will be both the Tsar of Rus and the Basileus of East Rome." 
 ab_russia_romania_title: "Balkan Intervention" 
 ab_russia_romania_desc: "The next step of our great conquest are the divided states of the Wallachians, Moldavians, and Transylvanians. With these territories under our control, we can then expand further into Europe proper." 
 ab_russia_moravian_legacy_title: "Legacy of Great Moravia"
 ab_russia_moravian_legacy_desc: "The first of the Slavs to deny the old pagan ways and embrace the light of Christ. The brothers Cyril and Methodius created the first slavic alphabet to help spread the true faith amongst the people. The once proud state of Moravia has fallen from grace, but their legacy lives on in us." 
 ab_russia_poland_title: "Unite the Sons of Lech" 
 ab_russia_poland_desc: "The Sons of Lech, more commonly referred to as the Polish, have been disunited for centuries. Infighting and civil wars after their Christianisation has left them weak and vulnerable to outsiders. We will reunite the Lechs and bring another Slavic brother back into the fold." 
 ab_russia_bulgaria_title: "Unite with Bulgaria" 
 ab_russia_bulgaria_desc: "Bulgaria has been the true Orthodox power in the Balkans since the decline of Byzantium. Their literary schools rank among the best in the world for their teachings and efficiency. We will relieve them of the burden of administering their vast state and show them how efficient the Sons of Rus are at ruling." 
 ab_russia_finnish_frontier_title: "Finnish Frontier" 
 ab_russia_finnish_frontier_desc: "The Finns have served as a frontier between the Norsemen and Russians, with neither Novgorod nor Sweden ever successfully conquering the region. While the Swedes may succeed in their grand crusade against the heathens, we still do not want any battles to be fought in Russia proper. The heathen Finns will embrace the light of Christ and learn to speak Russian." 
 ab_russia_secure_baltics_title: "Secure the Baltics" 
 ab_russia_secure_baltics_desc: "The Baltic states have somehow miraculously resisted attempts to convert them from both east and west. The Prussians, Lithuanians, Estonians, and Livonians constantly fight both themselves and crusading Germans, yet no power has come out on top. There should be little resistance to our expanding empire." 
 ab_russia_panslavism_title: "Embrace Pan-Slavism" 
 ab_russia_panslavism_desc: "The three Slavic brothers of Lech, Czech, and Rus have long been separated, but now we have brought the three brothers back together. While we may not agree on religion, with Catholics, Orthodox, and even a few Protestants, we are all Slavs, and we will stand together against all our foes."
 ab_rus_westernise_navy_title: "Westernise the Navy"
 ab_rus_westernise_navy_desc: "As it turns out, when a majority of your ports are frozen over half the year, your budget does not give much focus on the navy. Because of this, we have fallen significantly behind our rivals in the west. This cannot stand, we need to find a friend in the wide ocean of Europe to help us catch up and be a true naval power." 
 ab_russia_tame_steppe_title: "Break the Hordes" 
 ab_russia_tame_steppe_desc: "The hordes have been the eternal rival of Kievan Rus, with over five centuries of conflict between us. For a while, the hordes have nearly shattered Rus, but now we lead the charge into their homelands. No more will they ever raid us again, the hordes will now learn what it is like to have a harsh master." 
 ab_russia_harness_steppes_title: "Harness the Steppes"
 ab_russia_harness_steppes_desc: "With the horde problem now pushed back and less of a significant threat, we must turn towards our newly conquered areas that are quite undeveloped. Bringing in proper settlers like we have in Sevastopol and encouraging economic growth will help turn these barbarous steppes into a vital part of our economy." 
 ab_russia_caucasian_border_title: "The Caucasian Border" 
 ab_russia_caucasian_border_desc: "The Caucasian mountains have long separated the steppes and Rus from Anatolia and the Middle East. The tenacity of the people and the sheer inhospitality of the mountains create a natural fortification from any threats to the south. With the border under our control, we can prevent any resurgent empire from attacking our vulnerable southern flank." 
 ab_russia_central_asia_title: "Conquer Central Asia"
 ab_russia_central_asia_desc: "Our relentless push eastwards has run into a roadblock with several Mongol successor states occupying the region. Fortunately, we have plenty of experience dealing with these hordes. Our soldiers will ensure that their destruction is swift and brutal." 
 ab_russia_dragon_title: "The Dragon and the Tsar" 
 ab_russia_dragon_desc: "Our push eastwards has reached its climax, and our discovery of another superpower has divided our court. Some view the Dragon Throne as a threat that we must defeat in battle to secure the east as ours. Others view the Chinese Emperor as an ally who would benefit from new trade routes between our great states. Of course, the choice is ultimately up to the Tsar." 
 ab_russia_empower_title: "Empower the Clergy" 
 ab_russia_empower_desc: "The Boyars and merchants have a long history of opposing the leadership of the Tsardom. The only institution to have always shown their loyalty to our people is the Church. The people of Rus are faithful and the clergy are willing to provide more legitimacy and taxes to our government in exchange for more privileges." 
 ab_rus_lavra_title: "Restore Pechersk Lavra" 
 ab_rus_lavra_desc: "Once a small monastery, the Pechersk Lavra has become the centre point of Eastern Orthodoxy in Ruthenia. Years of occupation from the Mongols and deterioration has resulted in this once grand monastery to become a small remnant of its former self. It would please the local clergy and bring peace of mind to the peasants if we restore it." 
 ab_russia_patriarchate_rus_title: "Patriarchate of All Rus"
 ab_russia_patriarchate_rus_desc: "Rus is a vast land filled with numerous autonomous bishops and priests who spread the true faith. While there is no real issue with this, we can promote a more unified national identity. One Patriarch shall oversee the entire church and ensure a unified doctrine amongst our people." 
 ab_russia_church_state_title: "The Church and the State"
 ab_russia_church_state_desc: "The clergy has been promoted to the most influential group in our government. All across the land, the Clergy works hand in hand with the ministers of the Tsar to ensure local laws are being followed and that all the people are faithful. We must further solidify this relationship between the church and state to ensure that the Mighty Bear of Rus does not falter in her quest to conquer all that belongs to her!"
 ab_russia_autocratic_title: "Autocratic Rule" 
 ab_russia_autocratic_desc: "Changes are coming to Europe. The idea of the divine right of monarchs to rule their state is extremely appealing to the Tsar. Unfortunately, forces across the government refuse to let go of their ancient powers. Placating these factions while increasing the power of the Tsar is our new top priority." 
 ab_russia_streltsy_title: "Modernise the Streltsy" 
 ab_russia_streltsy_desc: "The Streltsy are a social class of poor farmers who excel at use of firearms. Sadly, we have not been in the greatest of financial situations and the Streltsy class usually farms to accommodate our lack of wages. This results in more time farming and less time campaigning or training. By actually paying these soldiers their wages and making sure they spend their time training, we can ensure the Streltsy remain a professional corps in our army." 
 ab_russia_manufactories_title: "State Manufactories" 
 ab_russia_manufactories_desc: "Most of our income comes from taxing the peasants and tariffs placed on exported raw materials. We have no shortage of raw materials from our conquest of Siberia, and it would be more profitable to transform these materials into more profitable goods to export at higher rates. The state shall sponsor manufactories across the land to boost our production." 
 ab_russia_prikazy_title: "Establish the Prikazy" 
 ab_russia_prikazy_desc: "Our lands are vast and quite difficult to administer. There are just too many villages and outposts spread too wide across our Tsardom. The Tsar has taken it upon themself to create a new organisation method for our territories called the Prikaz. Each of these Prikazy will be administered by different parts of our government to ensure maximum efficiency." 
 ab_russia_industrial_title: "Industrial Centers" 
 ab_russia_industrial_desc: "Innovations from the west have created a new type of machine that is able to harvest coal from deep below the earth. That coal can then be used to help boost our production by over tenfold. We just need to pay the fees to build these new furnaces." 
 ab_russia_revolution_title: "Answer the Revolution" 
 ab_russia_revolution_desc: "The winds of change are sweeping through Europe, ideas of liberty and equality and clashing with the ideas of autocracy and supremacy of old. The peasantry have clung to these new found ideas and the aristocracy is fighting to put down the flames of revolution. What path will we follow in this pivotal moment in history, will we ensure the authority of the Tsar, or spread freedom throughout the east?" 
 ab_russia_stabilize_title: "Stabilise the Interior" 
 ab_russia_stabilize_desc: "The lands of Rus have not known peace of prosperity for years, and now that we have united these war torn lands, we can start to make life better for everyone. Of course we need to ensure the government is profitable and loyal before we can help the peasants. " 
 ab_russia_bread_title: "Ruthenian Chernozem" 
 ab_russia_bread_desc: "Chernozem is a nutrient rich black soil which is abundant in the lands of Ruthenia. Its properties allow for extremely efficient production of wheat. By subsidising local farms and mills in the region, we can ensure that there will always be a surplus of bread for our people. No one will ever go hungry again!" 
 ab_russia_fur_title: "Expand the Fur Market" 
 ab_russia_fur_desc: "The fur trade in Western Europe has driven the beaver population to near extinction, which has left Europe without fur. Luckily for us, Siberia has plenty of furry animals for us to harvest. With a little bit of funding from the Tsar, we can expand our fur market to help dominate the European fur market and turn remarkable profit." 
 ab_russia_capitals_title: "The Two Capitals" 
 ab_russia_capitals_desc: "Two great cities have long been in a friendly rivalry over who will be the centre of Rus. Novgorod to the north has grown to great heights during the years under the Tartar yoke. Meanwhile, Kiev remains the ancient capital of Rus and still is the most important city in Ruthenia. The Tsar wishes to transform one of these mighty cities into the capital of our Tsardom, but that does not mean we can just ignore the other." 
 ab_russia_hometrade_title: "Control the Home Trade" 
 ab_russia_hometrade_desc: "Our lands have plenty of resources that we wish to trade with our contemporaries in the west. Sadly, the harsh environment of the taiga and tundra makes trading difficult half the year. You have to spend money to make money, and the Tsar is willing to spend money to create trade centres that remain open year round." 
 ab_russia_window_title: "Window to the West" 
 ab_russia_window_desc: "Kiev and Novgorod are grand cities, but their location is not the most accessible to the West. The Tsar has funded surveys across the coast and discovered a perfect location for a city in Neva. This small harbour will become a grand rival to Novgorod and Kiev, but have the added benefit of being able to trade freely with the west."

# Events #
 ab_novgorod.1.t: "Boyar Insurrection"
 ab_novgorod.1.d: "Novgorod largely managed to escape the horrors of the Mongol invasion. Instead of being conquered, the Republic agreed to become a tributary of the Golden Horde, paying tribute to the Khan in Sarai. Untouched by the destruction caused during the invasion of Rus', the republic prospered thanks to trade with the Hanseatic towns, farming and animal husbandry. Over time, Novgorod abused its safe position and largely expanded its borders, becoming the most powerful successor state of Kievan Rus. Recently, in the wake of the weakening Tatar Yoke, many Russian principalities managed to free themselves of their Mongol overlords. Due to that, Boyars of Novgorod have been pushing the government to take an action and start a military campaign in which they wanted to bring weaker Princes under our suzerainty, but their request fell on deaf ears. Angered by the stance of the government, they have united under the leadership of Rostislav, a young prince from the House of Rurik, and are marching on the capital, demanding the government to step down and let the Boyars seize power in Novgorod. What should we do?"
 ab_novgorod.1.a: "Accept their demands"
 ab_novgorod.1.b: "Unthinkable!"
 ab_novgorod.2.t: "The Foundation of Bogdangrad"
 ab_novgorod.2.d: "At the confluence of the rivers Neva and Okhta, in the sparsely populated land of Ingria, lies the potential gateway to Baltic trade, and through that, the untapped German markets. A most enticing prospect for the merchants of Novgorod, the desire to establish a permanent outpost in Neva has gripped the public's interest as of late. This desire influenced perhaps none more so than the enigmatic Brothers Bogdanov - heads of lucrative Bogdanoff and Bogdanoff Merchant's Guild. Bankrolling one of the largest private expeditions in Novgorod's history, the Bogdanovs have quickly set about laying the groundwork for a sprawling megalopolis and trade hub which they describe as the 'Window to the West.' Upon its completion, the city of Bogdangrad is expected to entrench the Bogdanovs' influence over Novgorod, and lay the Hansa bare before them. Forward, to the West!"
 ab_novgorod.2.a: "They bought? Bump it."
 ab_novgorod.3.t: "The Patriarchate of All Rus'"
 ab_novgorod.3.d: "Ever since Saint Olga of Kiev’s conversion, we have successfully evaded the strong influence of the Purple Phoenix in our affairs. With all of Russia under our control, and one Orthodox faith uniting us all, our leadership and emancipation has become clear. In spite of the Ecumenical Patriarch’s vain hopes, for the first time we shall have a united Patriarchate, encompassing all Rus’ and independent of the church of Constantinople."
 ab_novgorod.3.a: "Hallelujah!"
 ab_novgorod.4.t: "The Restoration of Rus"
 ab_novgorod.4.d: "The tyranny of the Tatar yoke, the rotten wishes of our ancienmost enemies, the malevolent ambitions of a Rome past its prime. The Rus’ have endured and conquered each of these fears, each of these opponents. Our way is clear to become the largest empire known to man, and we must not spoil this golden opportunity. Rejoice, Mother Rus', for your children will be Tsars!"
 ab_novgorod.4.a: "And the world shall tremble!"
 ab_novgorod.5.t: "The End of the Crusade"
 ab_novgorod.5.d: "The Swedish lions, heathen and heretic alike, have been tamed; the aegis of the Rus’ now looms above the Baltic Sea like Rome’s once did the Mediterranean. The rich cities and plentiful mines of the Swedish kingdom now serve our state."
 ab_novgorod.5.a: "The beast is tamed. Hooray!" 
 ab_novgorod.6.t: "The Destruction of Sarai"
 ab_novgorod.6.d: "Sarai, stronghold of the Steppes, from whence once Mongolian warlords extorted tribute and persecuted our forefathers, is ours. While the obvious choice would be to sack it, like they would any city of their own conquest, our merchants argue that it could become more useful and prosperous under our hands than it ever was before."
 ab_novgorod.6.a: "Nay, burn it!"
 ab_novgorod.6.b: "The Steppes have shed enough blood"

Petty rivalries between princes prevented cooperation and led to a state of fragmentation and squabbling. A state that we have, as the dominant power of the region, now rectified. No more will we be divided, from within or without!"
 ab_nov_dniepr_title: "Secure the Dnieper"
 ab_nov_dniepr_desc: "The Dniepr is one of the most, if not the most important river in all of Rus. The Mongols made a grave mistake by not fully controlling all of it, allowing numerous powers to split the river. If one nation were to control the most important estuaries of the Dniepr, then their dominance over Ruthenia would be secured. That nation will be us."
 ab_nov_heirs_title: "Heirs of Ruthenia"
 ab_nov_heirs_desc: "The once shattered Rus has been reforged by the fire in the hearts of our people. The principalities have been united, and the Horde is in full retreat. Now it is time to claim the title as the true Heir of Ruthenia truly. We will lead the Slavic world towards a new future under the new Tsar. God Save Rus! God Save the Tsar!"
 ab_nov_pskov_title: "Conquer Pskov"
 ab_nov_pskov_desc: "The Baltic is our Window to the West. Pskov, once the furthest-west Russian state, was once the only thing between us and controlling the eastern Baltic Sea. Now, we have brought them into the fold."
 ab_nov_baltic_title: "Window to the West"
 ab_nov_baltic_desc: "While our main trading port in the Gulf of Finland serves us well, the snow and ice make it useless for almost half the year. Expanding to warmer waters, we can now continue our shipping year-round, cementing our control of the eastern Baltic Sea and putting us in place to control it!"
 ab_nov_lithuania_title: "Defeat the Lithuanians"
 ab_nov_lithuania_desc: "The Lithuanians have fallen like the rest, brought to heel and integrated into our ever-expanding domain. But we will not stop here. Novgorod will prevail, and we will create our own Mare Nostrum in the Baltic Sea!"
 ab_nov_baltic_security_title: "Baltic Security"
 ab_nov_baltic_security_desc: "Lithuania fell, and soon did the Prussians after them. One of the most important trading cities of the Baltic Sea, Danzig, now sits firmly within our grasp. We are already reaping the benefits of increased trade from the west, but why stop here? The riches of the Baltic Sea await!"
 ab_nov_fur_title: "Expand the Fur Trade"
 ab_nov_fur_desc: "The abundance of northern game animals within our realm means both a supply of meat for our people and an abundance of fur to trade. While not as lucrative as silk or gold, it is still a valuable resource. Our expanded fur trade will be one of many pillars of our economy."
 ab_nov_hegemony_title: "Baltoscandian Hegemony"
 ab_nov_hegemony_desc: "We now sit as the strongest power in the Baltic Sea. Even grander than Cnut’s Northern Empire. Riches flow to our capital, people are happy, and our children may grow fat and old on the fruits of our labour. What the future will look in store for us now looks even brighter."
 ab_nov_finland_title: "Secure Finland"
 ab_nov_finland_desc: "The pagan Finns to our east have proved valuable in the past. First, they proved a helpful buffer and distraction against Viking raids. Then, when the Vikings were replaced with Swedish crusaders, they were beneficial against them too. Now, they have outlived their usefulness. The Gulf of Finland is now entirely in our control, as well as the rest of Finland itself."
 ab_nov_sapmi_title: "Subjugate the Sápmi"
 ab_nov_sapmi_desc: "The Sápmi people fell as the Finns did before them, the last remaining holdout of the Suomenusko pagans. The Ukko shrine will remain – for now. But one thing is for certain: this land belongs to us now. Regrettably, this puts us in direct contact with the Norwegians and Swedish Crusaders, but perhaps their conflicts could be used to our advantage."
 ab_nov_crusade_title: "End the Crusade"
 ab_nov_crusade_desc: "The conflict of faith that the Swedes brought to the Baltic states has finished. Their crusade is over, doomed to fail from the start, and their lands are ours now. The only question now is what to do about these Norsemen on our doorstep...?"
 ab_nov_rein_princes_title: "Expand the Domain"
 ab_nov_rein_princes_desc: "While we are undoubtedly the largest domain among our peers and lesser to the south, it is no secret that much of our lands are barren and frigid wastes. Therefore, we must seek out more land to bolster our resources."
 ab_nov_end_rurik_title: "End Rurik's Bloodline"
 ab_nov_end_rurik_desc: "Rurik’s blood still flowed through the rulers of the land, princes who spit in the face of what was once the greatest realm since the Roman Empire. We have made sure that the weed has been nipped in the bud. Control of the region has been wrenched from Rurikovich hands. We are all the better for it."
 ab_nov_perm_title: "Secure Perm"
 ab_nov_perm_desc: "Much as the Baltics are our Window to the West, Perm remains our Window to the East. It’s an independent princedom that stands between the Urals and us, useful as a trading partner and even more so as a buffer state. However, if we want to break past those mountains, we must subjugate them or integrate them into our lands outright."
 ab_nov_beyond_title: "Beyond the Urals"
 ab_nov_beyond_desc: "Like a childhood home, the Ural Mountains offer us shelter from invasion from the East. But, like all childhood homes, there comes a time when the child must move on. We will break past the safety of the Urals and swarm east just as the Mongols once swarmed west!"
 ab_nov_mother_cities_title: "The Mother of Cities"
 ab_nov_mother_cities_desc: "Great Kyiv! Holy Kyiv! The Mother of Cities! Ruthenia’s grand capital has been restored to its former glory! May it forever remain a beacon for all of Rus! May it reign forevermore and never fall again!"
 ab_nov_threaten_rome_title: "Threaten the Romans"
 ab_nov_threaten_rome_desc: "With Crimea held, we are free to expand to all shores of the Black Sea as we please. We may even threaten the Romans in Constantinople! Now that our mighty southern fleet has been built up, we can grow to our heart’s content!"
 ab_nov_crimea_title: "Control Crimea"
 ab_nov_crimea_desc: "Crimea is the last step of a trade route that spans through rivers and over land from sea to sea. The route from the Baltic to the Black Sea is ours and ours alone. We will reap the rewards, for they are plentiful!"
 ab_nov_mongols_title: "Banish the Mongols"
 ab_nov_mongols_desc: "The Mongols, the scourge of this land and our people, are no longer! We have defeated them in battle, taken their forts, and driven them from our lands. If they return, we’ll be ready!"
 ab_nov_wendia_title: "Wendish Intervention"
 ab_nov_wendia_desc: "Much like the eternal conflict between the Norse and Crusaders to the north, the Wendish states to the south of the Baltic are stuck in war after war against themselves. It is time we do something about it and end their fighting."
 ab_nov_toll_title: "Control the Sound Toll"
 ab_nov_toll_desc: "The Sound Toll at the mouth of the Baltic Sea is in Danish hands no longer. It is only fitting that, as the Hegemon of the Baltic Sea, it belongs to us. Like the Hellespont, it shall stand as a gate to our bountiful and glorious empire!"
 ab_nov_new_world_title: "Discover the New World"
 ab_nov_new_world_desc: "Our more daring explorers have set sail beyond the horizon, following mere rumours from Norwegian fishermen and sailors in our realm. They have returned bearing stories of not only lands like ours but lands more bountiful than we could ever dream of."
 ab_nov_new_rus_title: "Found New Rus'"
 ab_nov_new_rus_desc: "Our colonial presence in the New World has been firmly established. New Rus shall be our stronghold in this foreign realm, which we shall base our further efforts on. A jewel in our Empire will be a prime example of our prestige."
 ab_nov_canada_title: "Tame the North"
 ab_nov_canada_desc: "The northern areas of this new world are much like our homeland. There aren’t many others as well suited to this land as the Rus! We will not just survive here, but thrive! This shall be a new home for our people, and a cornerstone of our great Empire."
 ab_nov_greenland_title: "Claim Greenland"
 ab_nov_greenland_desc: "Greenland is an island between Iceland and this new world. Walrus tusks have become quite a commodity, and Greenland is abundant in them. A land so bountiful and close to our realm open for the taking? It’s almost too easy."
 ab_nov_westernise_navy_title: "Westernise the Navy"
 ab_nov_westernise_navy_desc: "Throughout our naval campaigns along the Baltic Sea, it has been clear to us that our navy could be better. Decades of lagging behind have left our strongest ships in shambles against our foes. Using modern designs, we have learned from our enemies and improved our ships."
 ab_nov_gotland_title: "Deal with the Pirates"
 ab_nov_gotland_desc: "Raids on our (and most other shores of the Baltic) will come to an end. Gotland is ours, the pirates who lived there before were driven out or captured. One more stone on the path to Baltic security has been laid."
 ab_nov_baltic_fleet_title: "Baltic Arsenal"
 ab_nov_baltic_fleet_desc: "In order to enforce our authority in the Baltic Sea, we were required to modernize our navy. Pirates, Norsemen, Crusaders, Wends, and the Hansa all pose threats to us. With our new, mighty fleet, we’ll have the strength to force them all back!"
 ab_nov_reform_veche_title: "Reform the Veche"
 ab_nov_reform_veche_desc: "The Veche of Novgorod has served us well, offering the peoples of our lands a say in our policies. As we have grown, however, the cracks in the systems have begun to show. Our reforms will correct this and stabilise our growing trade network."
 ab_nov_trade_network_title: "Northern Trade Networks"
 ab_nov_trade_network_desc: "The frigid lands of our home have been tamed. Through our public works, we have created a vast trade network over ice and snow that will work even through the harshest winters. Not only with this increase productivity, but the connection between towns and settlements will allow information to flow quickly and freely."
 ab_nov_rusa_title: "Rusa Salt Mine"
 ab_nov_rusa_desc: "The salt mines of Rusa are a valuable resource in our trade network. By expanding it and increasing its output, we will have enough for ourselves and our trading partners abroad."
 ab_nov_bogdanov_title: "Bogdanov Trading Guild"
 ab_nov_bogdanov_desc: "The Bogdanov Trading Guild has come into prominence in recent years. They are influential, widespread and, most importantly, rich beyond belief. They are willing to cooperate and will be a powerful asset to us."
 ab_nov_patriarchate_rus_title: "Patriarchate of All Rus"
 ab_nov_patriarchate_rus_desc: "The Patriarch will be held back by Constantinople no longer! The Patriarchate of All Rus reigns supreme over these lands and their people, tying our bonds closer together than ever before. Now, we can indeed be greater than even the Romans themselves."

 ab_ghorde.10.t: "The Conversion of the [Root.GetAdjective]"
 ab_ghorde.10.d: "Even before the we came to rule these lands, many faiths clashed on the steppe, gaining their own followers and challenges. With our recent conquest and generations of rule, the Muslims of the Volga have been allowed to flourish and grow, Christian missions have frequented the ports of the Crimea, and several rulers of the empire have invited Buddhists to settle in our important cities and some of the more eastern regions of our domain. With recent troubles seeming to have finally been put behind us, some within the Khan’s court have begun to discuss formally adopting a more settled faith in order to facilitate better relations with our neighbors moving forward."
