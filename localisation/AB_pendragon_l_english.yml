 DMA_first: "The Archbishop of Kernow"
 DMA_first_desc: "The lands of Cornwall and Devon were Christianized centuries prior, during the so called low-roman period. Ever since then, the area has had a strong Christian tradition, and a distinct one from the Anglo-Saxon practice. More orthodox, more akin to the insular tradition of Ireland, even during our period of subjugation under the Anglo-Saxon we still retained our own sense of self and practice. Now, with the flourishing state of Dumnonia raking in the wealth of both the Isles and the New World, we can subsidize the creation of new churches and monasteries across the Kingdom, giving the Archbishop and the Church the respect that they deserve."
 DMA_second: "Riders at Mount Babon"
 DMA_second_desc: "It is said that during King Arthur’s defense against the mighty Anglo-Saxon invasions, he made a stand at Mount Babon, pushing back all those who attempted to press into his homeland. That Arthurian romanticism that birthed the Kingdom carries through here: We shall drive the Anglo-Saxon away, taking back our lands and rule as the sole dominating force over the isles!"
 DMA_third: "University of Exeter"
 DMA_third_desc: "In the heart of the modern metropolis of Exeter lies a great university, bustling with students and scholars alike. As technology advances with every passing year, the Kingdom of Dumnonia must remain at the forefront if it wishes to retain its status as a global power. Through extensive research grants and subsidies from the crown, the University of Devon is a wonderous place for scientific achievement and philosophical dialogues."
 DMA_fourth: "A Modern Senedh"
 DMA_fourth_desc: "Having spent several centuries under the Anglo-Saxons, we have taken their concept of a parliament and modified it to our liking. Instead of a single parliament under a unitary government, we shall establish smaller, local parliaments in each of our vassals so that they might also share the political freedom that is granted to us through the Senedh."
 DMA2_fourth: "A Modern Senedh"
 DMA2_fourth_desc: "Having spent several centuries under the Anglo-Saxons, we have taken their concept of a parliament and modified it to our liking. Instead of a single parliament under a unitary government, we shall establish smaller, local parliaments in each of our vassals so that they might also share the political freedom that is granted to us through the Senedh."
 DMA_fifth: "Charters to the New World"
 DMA_fifth_desc: "The lands of America call to us; their fertile fields, their vast open plains, their gold-filled cities all combine with our innate sense to explore and discover. We must establish colonial settlements across the new continent; to do this, we shall establish a new colonial administration division, that will grant charters to all those willing to take the voyage into the great beyond…"
 DMA_sixth: "Layys a Dumnonia"
 DMA_sixth_desc: "As the reformation sweeps across our continent, many of our princes are converting to the new faiths that arise in its stead. While we have been fierce defenders of the Catholic faith for centuries, our lawmakers and advisors have proposed that it would be beneficial to create wiggle room in the law, granting protection for those of these heretical faiths within our state to avoid the chaos and pandemonium that is rocking Europe. As such, Dumnonia is a place free from political persecution, welcome to all scholars, craftsmen, and soldiers of protestant and catholic faith alike!"
 DMA_seventh: "Pax Brythonek"
 DMA_seventh_desc: "The Brythonic people had been nearly wiped out by the Anglo Saxon and Gaelic peoples. However, thanks to our timely rise to power, the age of the Britons has returned to the isles! Our new state shall take a page out of the old Roman laws, that through servitude in the military, anyone can be considered a Briton. This will not only bolster our ranks, but also allow us to inspire a sense of loyalty across our new dominion."

 dumnonia_decision_desc: "The domination of the English complete and the ancient territories of the Dumnonii now under our control. Fueled by Arthurian Romanticism, calls to create a new state around both the ideals of the past and hopes for the future are loud and ever-present. We shall, on this day, found the Kingdom of Dumnonia!"

# Ideas #
 BRN_ideas: "Prydain Ideas"
 BRN_ideas_start: "Prydain Traditions"
 BRN_ideas_bonus: "Prydain Ambition"
 BRN_first: "Welsh Engineering"
 BRN_first_desc: "In the Era of the Romans, over one thousand years ago, the foreign empire utilized their technology to extract the valuable mineral wealth of our countryside. While the benefits of the projects all went to other parts of the empire, we shall use that technology to improve our kingdom and build infrastructure for the modern era."
 BRN_second: "Cyfarwydds Lawmakers"
 BRN_second_desc: "Welsh Laws were often created and upheld by kings and rulers, but they would be remembered by great lawyers. They sung code and relayed law as if they were poets, aiding their king in creating and controlling the realm. Working in conjunction with the Cyfarwydd, our storytellers, they can recite the law to any king as well as a peasant."
 BRN_third: "Prydain Legions"
 BRN_third_desc: "The Welsh People are descendants of the original Britons, those who served under the Romans. We shall draw to our heritage as great conquerors to reclaim and dominate these fair isles!"
 BRN_fourth: "Welsh Industries"
 BRN_fourth_desc: "Our hills have valuable resources, of which we cannot even comprehend. Fuel for furnaces, materials for muskets, and enough sheep to feed an entire battalion. We must continue to advance and develop our home territory, if we are to keep up with the foreign powers in Frankia and Germany."
 BRN_fifth: "Legacy of the Glywysing Revolt"
 BRN_fifth_desc: "In the mid 14th Century, the Glywysing rebellion broke out from within our Kingdom. The southern princedom of Glywysing, led by Dafydd Glywysing, claimed the throne during the tumultuous reign of the king Rodhri Gwynedd. With support from the English, this rebellion lasted for over 30 years, until Owain Gruffydd, a young and aspiring general, routed their forces in a daring encirclement. After this, Owain went on to act as the King’s right-hand man in subduing and quelling various rebellions across the kingdom. However, as time went on, support for Owain grew more and more, over even Rodhri. When the King died with no clear heir apparent, Owain easily slotted himself into the position in 1379, becoming the King of Wales."
 BRN_sixth: "Mountain Training"
 BRN_sixth_desc: "The heart of our kingdom is located in the mountainous wales region, and there our soldiers are trained. Running from hill fort to hill fort, surviving in the harsh environment, our soldiers are trained to survive in rough conditions and to move quickly, making our units ready to detach and maneuver through enemy lines."
 BRN_seventh: "Y Ddraig Aur"
 BRN_seventh_desc: "In the year 1362, during the Glywysing Revolt, Owain Glyndwr took the fight to the southern port city of Caerdydd. Pushing into the city, plundering the rebel holdings, he stumbled upon an unused Carrack that the had docked. Apparently, it was a gift from an English lord to the Welsh princes here, hoping they would use it in their efforts to win their war. When their crew had attempted to sail it all the way to Gwynedd, it was caught in a nasty storm, causing it to be damaged, and thus it needed to return to port for repairs. However, they didn’t realize that Owain's armies were marching on the city, and as such, brought it out of the frying pan and into the fire. It is said the Owain began to laugh when he found the ship, and immediately gathered some local sailors to help him sail it. He christened the ship the Golden Dragon, after his own personal standard. In the present, ships built across Prydain now fly the Golden Dragon Flag, the symbol of the Royal Navy."

 COT_first_desc: "The Cross of Chong was commissioned by the great Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair in 1227, and it has been a symbol for our piety and devotion to the church ever since. Constructed in the traditional Insular style, with reference to Gothic and Norse artworks, it not only showcases our heritage of the various clans and peoples within our fair isle, but also with a piece of the True Cross in its center, our holy relic is famous across the Christian world."
 COT_second: "Subdue the Kingdoms"
 COT_second_desc: "In the aftermath of the Treaty of Wexford in 1156, our position as the High King of Ireland has been put to the test. Our subjects have risen up time and time again in rebellion, either with pretenders or en masse as peasants. Be it in 1245 with the O’Brian raids, or in 1398 in the aftermath of the Peasant Uprisings, we have fought for our right to rule, and we shall do it again."
 COT_third: "The Three Connacht Castles"
 COT_third_desc: "In the year 1124, fortifications were placed in the settlements of Dun-Leodhar, Gailimh, and Cuil-maile. These fortifications aided us in the war with the Anglo-Saxons, giving us ground to defend ourselves. After the conflict, these fortifications were often rebuilt or strengthened by successors in order to shore up defenses against raiders. They stand strong to this day, defending our prized cities from all invaders."
 COT_fourth: "The Legacy of Tairrdelbach"
 COT_fourth_desc: "When Tairrdelbach rested the position of the High King from Muirchertach Ua Brian in the year 1115, he had gone forth and showcased his prowess as a military leader. Shattering the kingdom of Munster into three, and then defending the homeland from battles against the Anglo-Saxons, he was a true leader that many men feared. However, his failure to completely subdue these threats, both locally and abroad, left his descendants in a precarious position. They must be given an education and understanding in the art of warfare if we are to remove any threat that would come our way."
 COT_fifth: "The Tribes of Galway"
 COT_fifth_desc: "The Tribes of Galway came from all of the isle, and even from across the seas, from Iberia, Scandinavia, Frankia, and even England. They come bearing new and innovative ways to deal business, as well as help guide our lord in matters of economy and trade. With their help, we have expanded the city of Galway, and we should use their expertise to grow our other settlements as well."
 COT_sixth: "High King with Opposition"
 COT_sixth_desc: "Our Kingship has never truly been absolute; the title of High King has never been anything more than that, a title. The smaller Tuatha have been growing in power and influence, and those in Dublin and Cork now eye us with envy and greed. However, it is with both words and swords we will win them over. We must make peace with some of our enemies, granting them titles and claims in exchange for loyalty; that way we can assure loyalty even if we are vulnerable. And should they refuse the olive branch, we can always strike with the sword."
 COT_seventh: "An Irish Community"
 COT_seventh_desc: "Ireland has always been a hub for different peoples from Norseman to Saxons, traders and slavers, mercenaries and monks. We must not only listen to those from all walks of life to properly rule our fair island, but also learn from those foreign to us on new ideas and possibilities that we could use to create a new and better society for all."

 ab_ireland.1.t: "The Reformation in Ireland"
 ab_ireland.1.d: "The Reformation sweeps across the continent. States are falling to revolt and rebellion from the zealous ministers and followers of these new heretical faiths. However, for the Irish, this seemed like a distant problem; it was on the continent, why must they deal with it? However, recently, conversions have begun to spread across the channel and into our islands. England and Scotland are falling to the revolution, and we are at risk too. After a recent riot in our capital’s streets over the preaching of the Reformation, our lord took action, and made a brand-new decree."

 ab_ireland.3.d: "Our lord has promised the monastic orders that reside in our Kingdom that they would support them politically. However, they also said they would dedicate time and effort to go and study and pray with the monks. They would always find an excuse each year as to why they haven't spent hours upon end looking at dusty books, be it war, taxes, or rebellion. However, the monks have demanded that they come to the monestary and should we not, they would withdraw support. Going after the monks publically requested we did would make it appear as if we are subject to them, thus weakening our image. However, if we do not abide by their demands, the powerful church could intefere with our goals."
 ab_ireland.3.a: "Fine, pack my bags."
 ab_ireland.3.b: "Actually, my heir wishes to join the monkhood. They can take my place."

How can we remedy the situation?"

This was brought to our lord's attention immediately, and we waited for their decision."
 ab_ireland.5.a: "They dare slander my ancestors!? Send troops to disperse these peasants!"

 ab_ireland.7.t: "The Norse-Gael Conflict"
 ab_ireland.7.d: "He raises his sword, bringing it down quickly. He looks around and three more approach him from the right. Their weapons point at him, spears and sabers rattling as they draw nearer and nearer. He grimaces. This wasn’t what he signed up for. He was told he was to be sent off to fight in the Norse War, but he expected it to be a glorious fight for honor and for victory! This was just a fight in the mud. There was no honor here, just death and destruction. He avoided the two sabers headed for his chest, leaning to the side for one, and blocking the other. He kicked out his leg, pressing into their kneecap, and the enemy fell, screaming in pain. He lunged forward with his now free sword and jabbed it into the other’s neck. Taking a moment to breath, he looked over the battlefield. \n \nIt was pure chaos. Screams of men, the neighs of horses, the echoes of cannon fire. He looked back at the man rolling around in the mud: his knee was shattered. Slowly, he walked over, but heard the man muttering in some foreign tongue. While most was incomprehensible, he caught a word here and there. Mother. Father. Help. Heaven. This man was crying out to his family in Scandinavia, begging for someone to come save him. The soldier grimaced, and cut cleanly through his neck, ending his foe’s suffering. \n \nWhy was he here? Why was he fighting those who had the blood of Norsemen in them as well? [Root.Monarch.GetName], his lord, constantly called themselves a Nordic Gael, and yet, here they were, leading them into a fight with the very people they idolized and praised. It’s just insane, asinine, and…and… \n \nAnd then he saw them. Riding up on a horse, he saw [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] cut down a Scandinavian with a single strike. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] cried out, looking to the crowd surrounding them. 'Soldiers!  Do not hesitate! Do not falter!' [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] called over the battlefield, and all our soldiers turned to look at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. 'These men are our brothers, yes, but we cannot forgive them! They do not follow the true path! We are not just Irishmen, nor are we just Norse Gael; We are all children of the Heavenly Father!' [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] shouted, screaming at the top of their lungs with a powerful, commanding voice. The soldier got up, gripping his blade tightly and gritting his teeth. 'We shall force them to submit, but not to us, but to the only one who can command us! To Christ, who forgives us, who protects, who shall ask us to kneel before them when Judgement Day comes!' The soldier began to charge forward, spotting a Norseman aiming a musket at his lord. 'It is not a war to conquer, it is a war to save! Our brothers have lost their way, and they must return! Either on their own…' [Root.Monarch.GetName] raised [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] blade high, catching the sun's reflection. '…Or through the might of our holy blades!' The soldier jabbed his sword into the Norseman’s head, and they crumpled to the ground. He turned to look at [Root.Monarch.GetName], who nodded at him. 'Onwards!' And at that, a resounding cheer came from the army."

 ab_ireland.8.t: "Upstart Clan"
 ab_ireland.8.d: "Ireland is known for its ancient and dynamic clans, which rise to power as quickly as they might fall from it. Recently, a certain clan has made their intentions to surpass our own known to all. We must deal with this upstart in some way shape or form..."

 ab_ireland.8.b: "Bribe and replace their key supporters."

 ab_ireland.9.t: "Conversions to the Old Path"
 ab_ireland.9.d: "Recently, more and more nobles have become infatuated with the old Norse culture. Some, in the province of [Root.GetCapitalName], have even begun to convert to the old faith, worshipping gods such as Freja and Thor. It has spread across the city, a full on revival of the Norse faith. Of course, lords and peasants from around the lingdom are furious with this development, and are demanding that something be done immediately."
 ab_ireland.9.a: "Send in missionaries, by God, send the missionaries!"
 ab_ireland.9.b: "Wipe out this heathenry, burn them all if you have to!"
 ab_ireland.9.c: "While they took it too far, it is not a huge problem..."

 ab_ireland.10.t: "The Goidelic Election"
 ab_ireland.10.d: "The Goidelic state elects their ruler from a council led by the clans and the elite of our realm. They are picked from the same bloodline as the previous ruler, and while the process seems fair to the general populous, it is rife with power struggles and factions. Whoever comes to power is the one who has influenced the electors to vote for himself."

 ab_ireland.10.b: "The youngest brother of the King has been chosen"
 ab_ireland.10.c: "The second cousin of the King has been chosen"

 ab_ireland.11.t: "The Rise of the High King"
 ab_ireland.11.d: "Our soldiers barged into the palace of [From.GetCapitalName], slaughtering anyone that dared stand between us and our prize. The fighting was difficult; even with their backs pressed against the wall, the enemy stood firm. They knew what we were looking for, and they would die before they let our goals be met. Bodies began to pile, and our path became clear. When we found the High King, our soldiers brandished their weapons, forcing them to submit. We raised our hands to the skies in celebration, cheering the name of our new High King - long shall they reign!"
 ab_ireland.11.a: "To the new High King!"

 ab_ireland.12.t: "The Fall of the High King"
 ab_ireland.12.d: "Their soldiers barged into the palace of [From.GetCapitalName], slaughtering anyone that dared stand between them and their prize. The fighting was difficult; even with our backs pressed against the wall, our brave soldiers stood firm. We knew what they were looking for, and we would die before they achieve their goals. Bodies began to pile, and our numbers began to dwindle. Those that remained saw the hopelessness of the cause. When they found our High King, their soldiers brandished their weapons and forced them to submit. We bowed our heads in shame, cursing the name of our new High King - may they die young and sick."
 ab_ireland.12.a: "Fools, all of us."

 ab_ireland.13.t: "The Unification of the Clans"
 ab_ireland.13.d: "After brutal campaign after brutal campaign, we have finally dominated the entire island of Ireland. With the various clans now under our heel, we must work to unfiy them and subdue them to the true High King. From there, we shall expand our new kingdom to the isle of Briton and to the new lands in the far west!"
 ab_ireland.13.a: "All Hail the True High King!"
 ab_ireland.13.b: "Let us take pride in our heritage, as Norsemen and as Irishmen!"

 ab_ireland.14.t: "Collapse of the Irish High King"
 ab_ireland.14.d: "As the treaties were signed and the bodies were buried, the old castle of the Irish High King was all that remained in his possession. His domains taken, His already unloyal Ruirechs seizing the opportunity to cut ties; with daggers pointing from all sides one is to wonder whether the scarred husk of what once was High King is worthy of being called such. In the end what matters is that He collapsed, opening new opportunities for more ambitious, and worthy clans to vie the title."
 ab_ireland.14.a: "...and we pray we never see them again."

 ab_ireland.15.t: "Collapse of the Irish High King"
 ab_ireland.15.d: "As the treaties were signed and the bodies were buried, the old castle of the Irish High King was being raided. The banners and treasures from within were stripped down off the mantles that they hung on, ripped apart into tiny pieces, and tossed to the mud. Farmers and peasants were driven off the surrounding lands, while settlers came to found their new homes. Whether the High King was still alive or not mattered little; the seat of the High King had been usurped by a foreign invader."
 ab_ireland.15.a: "Our bonds to our previous High King no longer hold."
 ab_ireland.15.b: "The pretender is dead, now is our chance."

 ab_ireland.16.t: "Gaelic Administration"
 ab_ireland.16.d: "As we took the lands of the Welsh and the Highlanders, the nobles came to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and began to offer advice on how to rule this new land. They began to think that, perhaps, due to their shared relationship of being attacked by the English, that the Welsh and Highlanders could be more willing to join our administration. He quickly drafted up a new proclamation, and soon it was spoken about in every petty lord and fiefdom across the isles. The Gaelic community was welcome to come work with the Irish in their conquest of the English in exchange for wealth and power. Soon enough, messengers came pouring into our palace, offering [Root.Monarch.GetName] their aid and support."
 ab_ireland.16.a: "Another successful plan!"

 ab_ireland.17.t: "Of Ostmen and Irishmen"
 ab_ireland.17.d: "In the years following the collapse of the English control of the south, old Gaelic-Norse families began to regain control of the port cities of Dubh Linn, Waterford, and Cork. While their triumph over the English was celebrated, there was still tension. The Norweigans continued to raid the coastline of the Irish, and with the Gaelic-Norse paying homage to their Norse Heritage, it created conflict between the both rural and urban Irish populations. This came to ahead with the rise of our Kingdom conquering all of the Ireland. Rumors abound, [Root.Monarch.GetName] practiced witchcraft, and sacrificed children to Odin and Thor! Although mostly spread by ambitious nobles wanting to weaken the authortiy over their overlord, their words have consequences. A small peasant group led by the young noble Seamus Meic Bráenáin came up to our keep and demanded a parle with our king. He demanded to know what plans the Ostmen, as he called it, had with the Irish. This issue had plagued [Root.Monarch.GetName] for many months now, and they had already drafted up a proposal for a new form of governance to end this conflict. However, he knew it could still be a complicated affair. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stroked their chin, before nodding their head and opening their mouth to speak."
 ab_ireland.17.a: "The Ostmen and the Irish shall inhabit these isles as equals and as partners."
 ab_ireland.17.b: "The Ostmen are indifferentiable from any Irish born man."
 ab_ireland.17.c: "The Irish would do well to adopt our glorious heritage."

 ab_ireland.18.c: "Upon this fair isle we shall found the Norse-Gael Empire!"

 ab_ireland.19.t: "Subduing of the Irish High King"
 ab_ireland.19.d: "As the treaties were signed and the bodies were buried, the old castle of the Irish High King was being retrofited. The banners and treasures from within were quietly removed and replaced with new, foreign, banners. The court of the High King had new and strange guests, speaking a foreign tongue and bringing foreign customs, but no mistake was made that they were the ones in charge. The seat of the High King had been usurped by a foreign invader."
 ab_ireland.19.a: "...and we pray we never see them again."

 ab_ireland.20.a: "Our bonds to our previous High King no longer hold."
 ab_ireland.20.b: "The pretender is dead, now is our chance."

 ab_ireland.21.t: "Conquest of the Irish High King"
 ab_ireland.21.d: "As the treaties were signed and the bodies were buried, the old castle of the Irish High King was being demolished. The banners were set on fire, with no regard for their legacy, the ones found most beautiful were spared, and alongside timeless treasures were sent off to decorate a faraway court. Farmers and peasants were driven off the surrounding lands, while settlers came to found their new homes. Whether the High King was still alive or not mattered little; the seat of the High King had been conquered by a foreign invader."
 ab_ireland.21.a: "...and we pray we never see them again."

 ab_ireland.22.a: "Our bonds to our previous High King no longer hold."

 ab_ireland.23.d: "This hidden event is meant to help internal mechanics of the Irish High King."

 ab_ireland.24.t: "The High King as a Vassal?"
 ab_ireland.24.d: "The High King cannot be a vassal by definition. They are the ruler of all of Ireland, they are not subject to another man! However, our vassal used to hold this title. We now have an option, we can take this prestigious title or dismantle this institution."
 ab_ireland.24.a: "All hail [Root.Monarch.GetName], the new High King!"
 ab_ireland.24.b: "Throw that useless crown to the wolves..."

 ab_ireland.25.t: "The Conquest of the High King"
 ab_ireland.25.d: "The High King, the de jure ruler of all of Ireland, has been defeated by our troops and we have annexed all their lands! We now have an option, we can take this prestigious title for ourselves or dismantle this institution."
 ab_ireland.25.a: "All hail [Root.Monarch.GetName], the new High King!"
 ab_ireland.25.b: "Throw that useless crown to the wolves..."
 

 ab_ireland.26.t: "Exile of the Irish High King"
 ab_ireland.26.d: "As the treaties were signed and the bodies were buried, the old castle of the Irish High King was no longer occupied. At least not by the familiar face of the High King, stripped of his domains in the Emerlad isle and forced to set up residence on foreign lands; the seat of the High King had been conquered by a foreign invader."
 ab_ireland.26.a: "...and we pray we never see them again."

 ab_ireland.27.a: "Our bonds to our previous High King no longer hold."
 ab_ireland.27.b: "The pretender is dead, now is our chance."

 ab_ireland.28.t: "The High King in Exile"
 ab_ireland.28.d: "The High King, the de jure ruler of all of Ireland, has been pushed out of all of Ireland, his court now resides in foreign lands unfit for someone with the title of High King. As the ones to exile him we have the option to adopt the title, or to dismantle this institution."
 ab_ireland.28.a: "All hail [Root.Monarch.GetName], the new High King!"
 ab_ireland.28.b: "Throw that useless crown to the wolves..."

 ab_goidelic_revolution.1.t: "The Goidelic Revolution"
 ab_goidelic_revolution.1.desc_connacht: "With the unification of the Goidelic peoples by Connacht, with the Gaelic Scots, the Manx, and the Irish all serving underneath one banner, a new era dawns in the British Isles. The Goidelics have come together to form a new nation, the land of Goidelia, where all are equal in the eyes of the law. Some even speak of a new cultural legacy, of a new identity forming within the eyes of the nobles and intelligencia of the kingdom."
 ab_goidelic_revolution.1.desc_gaeldom: "With the conquest of the Irish complete, we now have the entirety of the Gaelic peoples within our Empire. However, we do not rule over them as conquerors, nay, we live together as brothers. The Irish and Highlanders might have been separated by the sea between us, but we speak a similar tongue, we worship the same God, and we share a common heritage of the ancient Celts. Together, along with the rest of the Goidelic people, we walk towards the future hand and hand, facing the world and its many threats as one."
 ab_goidelic_revolution.1.a: "Together, we are many acting as one!"

 ab_goidelic_revolution.3.t: "The Goidelic Revolution Succeeds"
 ab_goidelic_revolution.3.d: "In the streets of [Root.GetName], men barter and chat using a new Goidelic tongue. Books are written by monks and noblemen on the history of the Goidelic peoples. Mothers teach their children of their great heritage of conquerors and rulers. Goidelic has become the new culture of this land!"
 ab_goidelic_revolution.3.a: "Onwards, Goidelics!"

 ab_goidelic_revolution.4.t: "Rejection of the Goidelics"
 ab_goidelic_revolution.4.d: "The Goidelic revoltution has hit a road block. Not only are the people of [Root.GetName] uninterested, they outright reject the foundations of our new culture, and wish to keep their old, backward traditions despite our pressure."
 ab_goidelic_revolution.4.a: "We must let their anger settle before we attempt to convince them again."
 ab_goidelic_revolution.4.b: "We shall send some monetary support, perhaps that will soothe their anger."
 ab_goidelic_revolution.4.c: "Send troops to arrest anyone who is disrespecting the new culture!"
 
 ab_goidelic_revolution.5.t: "Apathy towards the Goidelics"
 ab_goidelic_revolution.5.d: "While the ideas of Goidelic culture has not been outright rejected in §Y[Root.GetName],§! very few seem to actually care. Some of the nobility have expressed interest, but nothing beyond that."
 ab_goidelic_revolution.5.a: "Apathy is better than rejection, I suppose."
 ab_goidelic_revolution.5.b: "Pay for a scholar to try and convince the nobles."

 ab_goidelic_revolution.6.t: "The Goidelic Era"
 ab_goidelic_revolution.6.d: "As the sun rises, our wise ruler [Root.Monarch.GetName] wakes to a new nation. One formed of the union of all Gaelic peoples, from the Irish, to the Scottish, and to those of other heritage that seek to join with us in this new age. From the streets of Dublin to the palaces of Edinburgh, the Goidelic Era has begun!"

# Ideas #
 CRK_ideas: "Cork Ideas"
 CRK_ideas_start: "Cork Traditions"
 CRK_ideas_bonus: "Cork Ambition"
 CRK_first: "Raiders of Munster"
 CRK_first_desc: "Our warriors were known for venturing into the lands of the O’Brians, pillaging and plundering the local countryside. We shall take that energy and enthusiasm and hone it into a professional army, strong and powerful enough to strike fear into the hearts of any opponents!"
 CRK_second: "Legacy of 1395"
 CRK_second_desc: "In the year 1395, the Anglo-Saxon marcher-lords of southern Ireland fought amongst each other as they tried to consolidate control over their domains. The Mac Oitir dynasty, hailing from the older Hiberno-Viking rulers of Cork, led a rebellion of peasants and displaced lords after the Anglo-Saxons attempted to extort us with their Black Rent. The fighting was brutal and bloody, with their forces being bled dry in the forests while we raided the towns. We managed to win the conflict thanks to our tenacity and the breaking of our enemy’s will. We shall continue to fight on, never to be conquered again!"
 CRK_third: "Lords of the City"
 CRK_third_desc: "The lords of the city are known across the isle as powerful and influential individuals. Their words hold sway on matters of trade, military, and diplomacy. They create treaties with the Vikings, make deals with the inhabitants of Britain, and send declarations of war to our enemies."
 CRK_fourth: "The Navy of Oitir"
 CRK_fourth_desc: "The Viking peoples, in particular, Ottir the Black, have always been an important part of our community – during the invasion by the Anglo-Saxons in 1110, the Hiberno-Viking navy sailed out to battle with the enemy Navy. While we lost that fight, we have since learned lessons about how to duel on the sea, and our rulers have saw fit to better fund and deploy our ships out on the open water."
 CRK_fifth: "Brave New World"
 CRK_fifth_desc: "Tales are oft told about a land to the far west, beyond the horizon. Our people seek this new world with vigor and hope, sailing on cargo ships, be it English or Iberian, or even Nord, they go towards a land of opportunity. We shall settle this new land ourselves and reap the riches of this new land for ourselves!"
 CRK_sixth: "Dominators of Trade"
 CRK_sixth_desc: "Our ships sail across the isles, up the coast and past the isles of Scotland, into the far reaches of the Scandinavia and beyond. From there, our merchants manage connections with the Slavic people of the far east, and with them we trade our furs and sheep for their salt, iron, and wine."
 CRK_seventh: "Evolving City"
 CRK_seventh_desc: "Cork, one of the largest cities in Ireland, is a city that is constantly evolving. Sections of the wall are destroyed, gates are remodeled, expansions and homes built seemingly as fast as they are ruined. However, no matter what changes, the heart and essence of our city, and the wealth and power that emanates from it, shall never change!"
 WTF_ideas: "Waterford Ideas"
 WTF_ideas_start: "Waterford Traditions"
 WTF_ideas_bonus: "Waterford Ambition"
 WTF_first: "Cuan Phort Láirge"
 WTF_first_desc: "The Waterford Harbor sits at the mouth of three rivers, Nore, Suir, and Barrow. From here, trade from the island flows outward, which we control and regulate from within our city. The positioning also allows us to project our power upriver, by sending ships and soldiers to patrol the trade flowing down into our harbor."
 WTF_second: "Rivalry of the Port Cities"
 WTF_second_desc: "We have long since been rivals of the cities of Cork, Wexford, Dublin, and Limerick. In 1035, the King Ragnall escaped a trap set by the Dubliner King Sitric. Ever since, our state has been eyed by the Ua Briains and Ua Cheinnselaigs, yet we have remained strong, and further still we seek to once more establish our domain to the west of River Barrow."
 WTF_third: "Land of Saint Declan"
 WTF_third_desc: "Saint Declan was one of the early saints in the 5th century who had Christianized the Munster region. His legacy remains in the region to this day, with the site of Declán of Ardmore standing proud. With ancient cathedrals and carvings of biblical tales, this site is a reminder of our heritage as Catholic peoples, and with our Hiberno-Viking rulers having converted some centuries ago, we remain in the light of the true path."
 WTF_fourth: "Peace with the Hinterlands"
 WTF_fourth_desc: "Like many of the Hiberno-Viking cities, our community was known for raiding and pillaging for resources and wealth. However, we have since made peace with the countryside, instead formalizing our relations, developing an agricultural and urban relationship with them. This has allowed a boom in our cities’ wealth and power, and we continue to find our treasury stacked to the brim with silver."
 WTF_fifth: "Modernized Gall Óglaigh"
 WTF_fifth_desc: "The Hiberno-Viking warrior bands, oft called the Gallowglass, roam around in support of various lords across the isles. With our wealth and access to foreign technologies, we shall help create a strong, modern mercenary force that is loyal to our kingdom and our kingdom alone."
 WTF_sixth: "Masters of the Sea"
 WTF_sixth_desc: "With access to Ireland’s vast forests and our own dockyards and harbors, we shall build a fleet unlike any has any seen in the isle’s history. This should be a suitable defense should enemies of both foreign and domestic come to challenge our power."
 WTF_seventh: "Aftermath of 1243"
 WTF_seventh_desc: "When we gained our independence from the English lord Adamnae, we were grateful towards the high king for giving support in the revolt. We have since learned that if we wish to expand our influence and our power on the isle, we must court the various kings and queens that rule here. Be it through marriage, gifts, or simple acts of kindness, we must make sure they would rather shake our hand than stab our throat. That way, in times of crisis, we shall have allies to fall back upon – however, should it be required, we can also use this friendship to ease them into a new position of vassalage underneath us."
 DUB_ideas: "Dubliner Ideas"
 DUB_ideas_start: "Dubliner Traditions"
 DUB_ideas_bonus: "Dubliner Ambition"
 DUB_first: "The Irish Melting Pot"
 DUB_first_desc: "Dublin is the largest city in Ireland, and its position as a major trading hub has attracted minds from across the world. Byzantine scholars, Frankish nobles, Nord traders, and fellow Irish ecclesiarches. This melting pot of ideas and cultures grants us access to concepts and plans yet to be thought of, giving us an edge in technologies and institutions over our neighbors."
 DUB_sixth: "The Modern Longphort"
 DUB_sixth_desc: "On the south bank of the River Liffey sits the largest port in all of Ireland. Built off the old Viking trading routes, various goods would pass through this city, generating massive amounts of wealth for the lords of the settlement. In the aftermath of the 1395 Rebellions, trade has recently begun to favor Irish merchants over British ones, and we shall capitalize on this failure on their part!"
 DUB_third: "Lessons of the Raids"
 DUB_third_desc: "For nearly 200 Years, Ireland was rocked by a series of attacks by Viking Raiders. While their attempts to conquer the island failed, their rulers assimilated into the Irish culture and Christianized shortly after. However, that image of the Viking raider has not left the minds of our people, and as such, we have adopted their lightning-fast raiding stratagems into our navy, hoping to make up for our smaller naval size with quick and brutal warfare."
 DUB_fourth: "The Diocese of the Christ Church Cathedral"
 DUB_fourth_desc: "In the year 1030, long before the Anglo invasions, the King Sitric Silkenbeard built this Cathedral. He had built this new cathedral to gain the loyalty of the Church, and rulers since then have sought both the advice and the patronage of the archbishop that resides there. To this day, we still sponsor the priests that staff this sacred building, in exchange for their loyalty to our rule."
 DUB_fifth: "Re-establishment of the Peregrini"
 DUB_fifth_desc: "When the Viking lords raided the island, many of the old Irish scholars fled to various other Christian kingdoms. However, with our kingdom and its rulers now being fully brought into the fold of the Catholic Church, we should utilize their knowledge and skill that they had gained to our advantage."
 DUB_second: "The Dublin Market"
 DUB_second_desc: "Our marketplaces, once known for their slaves and wool, now see shipments of timber and copper flow out of our city. Our wealth and power has grown even more as the continent fractures, and with new markets opening in the west, we find ourselves in a position to reap the benefits of our growing industry."
 DUB_seventh: "Raiders of Duibh Linn"
 DUB_seventh_desc: "Bitter is the wind tonight, It tosses the ocean’s white hair. Tonight I fear not the fierce warriors of Duibh Linn, Coursing on the Seven Seas. – Unknown. "
 FNG_ideas: "Finngaill Ideas"
 FNG_ideas_start: "Finngaill Traditions"
 FNG_ideas_bonus: "Finngaill Ambition"
 FNG_first: "Defense of the Home Country"
 FNG_first_desc: "Ireland has been the sight of constant invasions for the past 500 years. From Anglo Saxons to Vikings, this continent has been raided and its wealth taken to greedy kings across the seas. We Norse Gael came to this fair island and settled down here, and as such, we have a duty to protect it against all those who would attack it."
 FNG_second: "Cannons of Ímair"
 FNG_second_desc: "The house of Ímair is one of the great Norse-Gael dynasties that inhabited Dublin for centuries. Recently, with the invention of modern cannons and ballista weaponry, they had taken a liking to improving the alchemical make up of the gunpowder to make it even more explosive. Then, claiming that they needed to 'Prove themselves to their ancestors', they ran out into battle with an untested mix, and promptly had their heir lose all their limbs. We shall use it…better, than they."
 FNG_third: "The Catholic Norse"
 FNG_third_desc: "No matter how much we call to our forefathers, the Vikings, we are a firmly Catholic. We believe in the almighty God, and the power of the Pope in heaven. Both the Norsemen and those that rebel from the Church should remember that, lest they wish to find us at their shores with a cross and an axe."
 FNG_fourth: "Courting the Clans"
 FNG_fourth_desc: "Our new seat of power has given us extreme power; we must exercise caution when using it. We should gain the loyalty of the various clans that inhabit Ireland and utilize out connections with the merchant guilds of the coastal cities to further increase our control over the estates of the kingdom."
 FNG_fifth: "The Duibh Linn University"
 FNG_fifth_desc: "In the city of Duibh Linn, we are funding and supporting the growth of a brand-new intellectual class. While they write about and analyze the scientific and political revolutions from Europe and beyond, we shall take their research and implement it to better increase our global standings."
 FNG_sixth: "The Gallowglass Musketmen"
 FNG_sixth_desc: "While the era of the Gallowglass mercenary has begun to decline, we have instead taken them in and begun the creation of a modern, professional Gallowglass army core. Replicating the English Grenadier structure and utilizing Frankish and Andalusian army training tactics, we have created a force that all of the world shall fear!"
 FNG_seventh: "The Vikings of Éire"
 FNG_seventh_desc: "We shall come in the dead of night, while their kings and queens sleep, and their soldiers are weary. Like lightning, we shall strike and break through all defenses, setting houses ablaze and turning soldiers into cowards, fleeing at the sight of our warriors. Row after row of muskets will be fired, tearing through all those who dare put up a fight. May God help you, should ye come into conflict with the Vikings of Éire."

 wales_flavor.1.t: "Fate of Llundain"
 wales_flavor.1.d: "With the ancient Brittonic capital of LLundain now under our control, some of our advisors have been suggesting we place officials in the seats of power in the city that are loyal to us. Take lords and ladies from the home country and give them titles in the new city, to ensure that it will remain in our grasp. While this seems like a solid idea, it would also spark massive uprising from the local nobilitas. If we instead simply move wealth and resources into the city, it could make the local population more willing to adopt our customs and culture, especially the lords who wish to move up in our court systems."
 wales_flavor.1.a: "Let us place those loyal to Cymru in charge."
 wales_flavor.1.b: "The Anglo-Saxons are already entrenched; we cannot move them."

 wales_flavor.2.t: "Rise of Prydain"
 wales_flavor.2.d: "With the fall of the English by our hands, we now rise as the sole ruler of the British Isles. We are the heirs and successors to Britannia; we are the true descendants of Rome! Hail Prydain!"
 wales_flavor.2.a: "All hail [Root.Monarch.GetName], King of Prydain!"

 wales_flavor.3.d: "In the early 17th Century, the Welsh intelligencia began to formulate a new kind of thought around their culture and people. They harkened back to the period of legend and myth prior to the Anglo-Saxon invasion, when the Britons ruled the isle alongside the Romans. These Brittonic Revivalists were scoffed at by most as delusional, as fools that were pretending to be something they were not. However, some found this idea interesting, specifically the nobility who liked to dress themselves in titles and names as to feel more regal. Common folk cared little for it, as these prancing nobles still spoke Welsh or whatever language they were native to. Recently, however, the idea has seen another massive surge in popularity, spreading throughout the growing middle class and cities, with hundreds of thousands now calling themselves 'Britons'. This has been causing tensions with those who view the idea as ridiculous, and among those who are not Welsh, it is considered even more confusing and angering. Our lord, [Root.Monarch.GetName], pondered what to do about this growing movement, eventually deciding to sponsor and support this new movement, calling themselves a True Briton. This would be seen as the start of the Brittonic Revolution."
 wales_flavor.3.t: "The Rise of the Britons"
 wales_flavor.3.a: "The §GRevival§! of the §YBrittonic Culture§! begins"

 wales_flavor.4.t: "The Revolution Spreads!"
 wales_flavor.4.d: "Another noble accepts the truth of our heritage. It will take some time for the people to catch on, but with the nobility of the province on our side, it won't be long before the people too accept their Brittonic Past."
 wls_acceptance1: "The Revolution marches on!"

 wales_flavor.5.t: "Britons Entrenched"
 wales_flavor.5.d: "The populace of the province now accept Britons. While they still speak and act in the exact same ways as before, they now sing songs and write plays of the Britons. They speak of themselves less as residence of a town or village, but as a people of a community of Britons."
 brn_welsh_123: "Brittonic continues to spread!"

 wales_flavor.6.t: "Resistance from Locals"
 wales_flavor.6.d: "The local population refuses to withdraw their customs and heritage. Some believe that we are going to replace their language and faith and have accused our lord of being a tyrant. We stand against these accusations, but it is too late, and the populace has been whipped into a fury. We must calm them down somehow."
 brt_reject: "Wait for the Situation to calm down"
 brt_reject2: "We shall send the local lord some money to support us"
 brt_reject3: "Send in the garrison! We'll crush this little resistance"

 wales_flavor.7.t: "Nobles are Intrigued"
 wales_flavor.7.d: "Nobles in this province have begun to look into the Brittonic Revolution and are interested in what they see. They are asking for us to help them understand it more, and even send money to set up institutions to study and theorize about their people's past. Should we support this venture, their acceptance of the new idea would be far more likely than if we simply leave it alone."
 brt_apathy: "Here, take these books on the subject"
 brt_apathy2: "Here, use this to get a philosopher!"

 wales_flavor.8.t: "Briton Domination"
 wales_flavor.8.d: "With the majority of our home islands joining the Brittonic Revolution, the anxiety and anger towards it has cooled down significantly. Now, we can once more focus on spreading and expanding our empire, but now we do so as Britons!"
 brt_domination: "The Age of the Briton has dawned!"

 wales_flavor.9.t: "The Essex Revolt"
 wales_flavor.9.d: "The Lords of Essex found our Brittonic Revolution to be an opportunity. They used it to whip the local lords and peasants into a fury around our king, calling them a tyrant that wishes to wipe out all of the Anglo-Saxons. Many lords who both feared the revolution as well as those who simply wished for more authority and power, joined in with the lord. Across East Anglia, London, and Kent, lords tore down their banners and declared their support for their new lord in Essex!"
 rebellion_ess: "We shall crush this revolt!"

 wales_flavor.10.t: "The Highlander Revolt"
 wales_flavor.10.d: "The Highlanders of Scotland had disliked the Brittonic Revolution. A very real aspect of this revolution was the suppression and removal of local customs via the lords who practiced this new doctrine, some of whom would use their new authority from the crown to punish and imprison those who still followed the old traditions. This very case happened in the Highlands, and several lords of the old Kingdoms joined together to throw off their Briton lords, declaring themselves an independent Kingdom."
 rebellion_hsc: "We will drag them out of their Castles!"

 wales_flavor.11.t: "The Irish Revolt"
 wales_flavor.11.d: "The Irish people have always had a separate and unique identity to that of the British. The revolt of 1395 and the subsequent liberation of Irish settlements in the south from English control only furthered that divide, viewing themselves as distinct from the other Isles. This new revival angered the remnants of the Old High King's court, who gathered in the southern Munster region to begin plotting their rebellion. When they gathered enough support from the populace, they declared their independence from the Britons, claiming the title of High King of Ireland once more."
 rebellion_ire: "We shall end the High King once more!"

 AB_vke_branching_title: "Branching Mission"
 AB_vke_branching_desc: "This mission will change depending on how we deal with §YThe Debate of Irish§!."
 vke_branching_harmony_title: "Harmonise with the Irish"
 vke_branching_harmony_desc: "We are strangers in a strange land. Despite our intimate relationship with our homeland, we cannot deny our heritage. A rage, a passion, burns within us, alien to that of our neighbours. Despite this, we cannot deny that which binds us to the land and its inhabitants. Our blood runs green, however hot it burns. Our mead is pure and our maidens true. We share, despite our vehement identity, so much with the Irish. Perhaps instead of bloodshed, we must inspire kinship and respect."
 vke_branching_assimilation_title: "Become Good Irishmen"
 vke_branching_assimilation_desc: "This land is Irish. Centuries upon centuries of turmoil have seen this tranquil, bountiful landscape transformed by foreign incursions. Saxons, Norse, Welsh... they have all laid claim to this island and spilled not only our blood, but theirs too, in search of glory. Even Saracens have encroached upon our shores in their depraved Barbary raids, sullying our ancient shores. Perhaps we should fight against these incursions by embracing our wholly Irish past, green and wise, over the alien, exotic culture which has been strewn upon us."
 vke_branching_dominate_title: "Enforce Nordic Culture"
 vke_branching_dominate_desc: "The Irish are feeble. For thousands of years, they have squabbled with one another over pathetic forest sprawls and bumbling hill mounds. Their greatest warriors, so-called, have found themselves content with ruling silly little localities and clan holdings rather than laying claim to the island proper and defending their borders, as true men would. Only now, under our glorious conquest, has Ireland been truly united. It is only fit that the ways, culture and tongue of the conquerors proper be made the law of the land, for we Norsemen are surely superior."

 manufactory_revolution_vke_title: "Manufactory Revolution"

 emerald_isle_vke_title: "The Emerald Isle"
 emerald_isle_vke_desc: "Ireland, ever since the first English invasions in the 12th Century, has been a very decentralized area, with major settlements mostly hugging coastlines or river. Now, with an explosion in population thanks to our unification of the Isle, we must expand our infrastructure and towns to cover the entirety of the Emerald Isle, making it a shining bastion in the Christian world."
 expand_production_vke_title: "Production Expansion"

 celtic_unity_desc: "The Gaelic people of the Highlands and the Welsh country have recently come into our possession.

We should work with them if we are to maintain our newly integrated territories."
 invade_iceland_vke_title: "The Shores of Iceland"

 irish_question_vke_title: "The Debate of Irish"
 irish_question_vke_desc: "The Irish and Norse-Gaels have always been at odds. While we share many similarities, still, some see us as different.

# Events #
 mann_events.1.t: "The Manx Secession"
 mann_events.1.d: "A delegation of the Manx people have met with leaders of [NOR.GetName] in [NOR.Capital.GetName].  They have made an official request for independence, which does not come as a surprise, considering how loosely they have been governed by the crown for generations. We can, of course, dispute this action outright, as Mann is rightful [NOR.GetAdjective] clay. If we were to negotiate with them, however, perhaps we could fetch a ransom for their independence?"
 mann_events.1.a: "Nonsense. Execute the delegates!"
 mann_events.1.b: "The crown could use funds at the moment.."
 mann_events.1.c: "For Odin, we let them go. We have no use for them."

 mann_events.2.t: "The Coveted Manx Silk"
 mann_events.2.d: "Despite any doubts that may have been placed upon them, the explorers in search of silk, sponsored by the crown, have returned. These men return with more than just foreign treasures, but information regarding the creation and maintenance of silk products. These men have been granted some land in [4368.GetName] to establish an operation to produce this silk, and have pledged a portion of their profits to the crown as repayment for funding their expedition."
 mann_events.2.a: "Their silk shall cover my body. Truly regal!"

 mann_events.201.t: "The Search for Silk"
 mann_events.201.d: "Our efforts to modernize our economy and transition from one based on herding to one based on production has been fruitful. The people have benefited from this, and thus they are happy. A happy population is easy to govern.\n\nHowever, a small group of entrepreneurial explorers has recently petitioned the crown to set sail on an expedition into the Mediterranean in search of the trade secrets of silk.. Such an endevor would cost a sizeable amount to fund, but assuming it was successful, could have large implications on our economic future."
 mann_events.201.a: "They have [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s blessing. Go fourth."
 mann_events.201.b: "We have better things to do with said funds."

 mann_events.3.t: "The Cleansing of Strathclyde"
 mann_events.3.d: "It has been made apparent to us that the cultural differences between us and the other inhabitants of the British Isles are incompatible. Despite our previous efforts, many are resistant to integration into our union. For that reason, they must be put the the sword if they resist further integration attempts by the crown. The people of Strathclyde have been no exception, and it has been said that they are to be an example for those who resist future cultural integration into the empire. This may upset other people within Mann, but it is a small price to pay to make a statement as strong as this: Become one of us, or die like the rest of them."
 mann_events.3.a: "Welcome, Strathclyde, to the family!"

 mann_events.4.t: "Proclaiming the Imperium of Mann"
 mann_events.4.d: "Long has it been since the time of English hegemony within the British Isles. Through shrewd diplomacy and sheer military might, the might crown of Mann has united the isles under a single banner, the banner of Mann! To celebrate this achievement, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proclaimed a coronation ceremony, dubbing themselves the 'Emperor of Mankind' in honor of our Manx brethren throughout the Isles, as well as any overseas. The Imperium of Mann shall not only rule the Isles, but shall focus her sights overseas, be it into Scandanavia, Europe, or to lands far over the horizon.\n\nLong live the Emperor of Mankind! Long may he rule! Long live the Imperium of Mann!"
 mann_events.4.a: "Now, to manage those pesky folk to the south of us.."

 mann_events.5.t: "The Faithful of Mann"
 mann_events.5.d: "The pious among us would claim that we are a nation of devout Catholics, with nothing but love and admiration for the virgin, Mary, and her son, the Son of Man, Jesus. Funnily enough, there are many holdovers from the Norwegian times, claiming that the Allfather, Odin, is the king of our world. Though nominally a Christian, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a chance to set the record straight and to decide the official state relgion of [KOI.GetName]. Shall we continue to pursue the Gospel and the good word presented within? Or shall we adopt the faith of the Northmen?"
 mann_events.5.a: "Father, you are my God, and the rock of my salvation!"
 mann_events.5.b: "May the gods be praised, and may the Allfather guide us!"

 nrm_piety_of_the_state_title: "Piety of the State"
 nrm_piety_of_the_state_desc: "We are a land blessed by the Lord himself. But the clerical institutions have a wildly different idea how the religious matters are handled. We must secure the piety of the state and assume control over the church."
 nrm_the_royal_marines_title: "The Royal Marines"
 nrm_the_royal_marines_desc: "The maritime nature of our state demands adaptations of our military. We must establish the Royal Marines which shall protect the interests of [Root.GetUsableName] overseas."

 nrm_create_standing_army_title: "Found a Standing Army"
 nrm_create_standing_army_desc: "Although the Parliament sees this act with suspicion and fear, the recent wars as well as the threat of the Civil War have shown the need for a standing army under the command of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. We cannot let [Root.GetUsableName] be left unprotected in case of an enemy invasion."
 nrm_the_redcoats_title: "The Redcoats"
 nrm_the_redcoats_desc: "In the turmoil of the battle, troops can lose their orientation quickly and find themselves shooting on allies and comrades on accident.
