ab_mpf.1.t: "Studying the Classics"
ab_mpf.1.d: "'Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.'\nSo said Socrates, and his words hold as true today as they did more than a thousand years ago. The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong endeavour, and today, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] embarks upon a journey to delve further into the Classics and learn from the great teachers of centuries past. Every field shall be covered, of course, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] has expressed a special interest in..."
ab_mpf.1.a: "...the philosophy of the state."
ab_mpf.1.b: "...rhetoric and public speaking."
ab_mpf.1.c: "...the great conquerors of antiquity."

ab_mpf.2.t: "Graduation Day"
ab_mpf.2.d: "Several years ago, [Root.Monarch.GetName] began furthering their education with a deep dive into the Classics. Today, the fruits of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hard work are plain for all to see."
ab_mpf.2.a: "States will never be happy until rulers become philosophers."
ab_mpf.2.b: "I have often regretted my speech. Never my silence."
ab_mpf.2.c: "Only the dead have seen the end of war."

ab_mpf.3.t: "Festival of the Gods"
ab_mpf.3.d: "The tables are laden with good food and drink; truly, the gods have blessed us this year with a bountiful harvest. As [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] looks out upon the assembled guests, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] picks up [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] goblet and dedicates the festival:"
ab_mpf.3.a: "Hail Zeus!"
ab_mpf.3.b: "Hail Poseidon!"
ab_mpf.3.c: "Hail Demeter!"
ab_mpf.3.e: "Hail Ares!"
ab_mpf.3.f: "Hail Hera!"
ab_mpf.3.g: "Hail Apollo!"
ab_mpf.3.h: "Hail Athena!"
ab_mpf.3.i: "Hail Artemis!"
ab_mpf.3.j: "Hail the gods!"

ab_mpf.4.t: "The Pride of [146.GetName]"
ab_mpf.4.d: "There is not a single soul in the city of [146.GetName] that does not recognise the Parthenon. Originally a grand temple dedicated to the city's patron deity Athena, the Christians rededicated it centuries ago to their Virgin Mother and converted it into a church, a spit in the face of the true gods. All the faithful agree that we cannot suffer this state of affairs any longer. It will be the work of decades, perhaps even centuries..."
ab_mpf.4.a: "...but we must restore it, in Lady Athena's name."

ab_mpf.5.t: "The Parthenon, Restored!"
ab_mpf.5.d: "It is done. The Parthenon has been restored to it's former glory, and then some. Beautiful sculptures and friezes line the halls, and Athena Parthenos has taken her rightful place in the naos once again. In a grand ceremony, the high priest has rededicated the temple to it's true patron, and worshippers flock from across the country to pay homage to the goddess of wisdom."
ab_mpf.5.a: "Hail, Athena Pallas! Hail, Athena Promachos! Hail, Athena Polias!"

ab_mpf.6.t: "An Oracle Blinded"
ab_mpf.6.d: "High up on Mount Parnassus, in the province of [5152.GetName], stands a temple dedicated to Apollo, god of the Sun, healing, and prophecy. Though it was once home to the Oracle of Delphi, who Apollo blessed with his gift of prophecy, the long years of Christian rule have not been kind to it; it lies in a state of great disrepair, much to the shame of our high priests. Restoring it will be no small feat, but it must be done."
ab_mpf.6.a: "We cannot let our sight be clouded."

ab_mpf.7.t: "The Oracle, Restored!"
ab_mpf.7.d: "At long last, the work is completed; the temple to Apollo high on Mount Parnassus stands proud once more. Within it's adyton, the new Oracle of Delphi sits, ready to receive her petitioners and, with Apollo's guidance, divine their future. The first in line, of course, is [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]. The question [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] asks of the Oracle, along with her answer, is held close to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart, but the smile on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face speaks of only good omens."
ab_mpf.7.a: "O Pythia, divine our future!"

ab_mpf.8.t: "The New Temple on the Mount"
ab_mpf.8.d: "For centuries, the city of Jerusalem has been a holy place to the followers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Jews claim that their wise king Solomon constructed their First Temple in this place, and when their Messiah returns, He will raise another on the very same foundations. The Muslims believe it is where their Prophet ascended to the heavens, and in reverence they conduct their daily prayers facing in its direction. To the Christians, it is no less than the place where the Christ died for the sins of all mankind.\n Taking this into account, it should have come as no surprise that when [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] decreed that the Temple Mount would be host to a dedicated temple of Zeus, the local population reacted first with disbelief, then with outrage. The construction was bogged down by belligerents intent on preventing the perceived desecration of this sacred place, and on the day of its consecration to the King of Olympus, a full riot broke out in the city, though thankfully the ceremony itself remained undisrupted.\n The Abrahamic faiths have almost never seen eye to eye despite their shared roots, but for today it seems they are united against a common foe: us."
ab_mpf.8.a: "Oh, so when we do it, it's blasphemy?!"

ab_mpf.9.t: "Raising A New Runestone"
ab_mpf.9.d: "Our forefathers knew well the importance of remembering those who came before us and what they accomplished, carving their deeds into massive raised stones, called runestones. Although the practice has declined in favour of paper records, we still use them to honour truly momentous individuals and events.\n\n The [Root.GetClergyName] have determined that now is a fine time for the government to erect a new runestone; the only question is, what should it be in honour of?"

ab_mpf.10.t: "A-Viking We Will Go"
ab_mpf.10.d: "Our people have a long history of wanderlust, roving up and down the wild oceans and great rivers, in search of glory, gold, and adventure. As a new generation comes of age, perhaps we should take the opportunity to direct their efforts in a way that will benefit the state."
ab_mpf.10.a: "What better way to gain glory than in the army?"
ab_mpf.10.b: "A successful merchant will see much coin in his lifetime."
ab_mpf.10.c: "A life in the colonies is the greatest adventure of all!"

ab_mpf.11.t: "A Grand Blót"
ab_mpf.11.d: "There is no better way to honour the gods than with a blót, or blood-sacrifice. Every nine years, the grand blót is held: nine days of feasting, drinking, celebration, and of course, sacrifice. To properly prepare, the [Root.GetClergyName] need to know what form this year's sacrifice will take."
ab_mpf.11.a: "The gods will be satisfied with some animal sacrifices, surely?"
ab_mpf.11.b: "We shall sacrifice the finest of our herds to the Aesir!"

ab_mpf.12.d: "Jarilo, god of fertility and the spring, was born on the last night of February, Velja Noc, as the tenth son of Perun, the great god of thunder. On that same night, he was stolen across the sea to the underworld by Veles, Perun's archenemy, and raised there to guard his livestock. When Jarilo returned to the mortal world, he brought the springtime with him, and this we celebrate every year with a festival in his honour."
