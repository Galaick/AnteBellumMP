 alb_first: "Skanderbeg’s Osman Connections"
 alb_first_desc: "Our nascent state requires funding in order to push back the foreign invaders and establish our own bureaucracy, and who better to provide this funding than the Osman & Sons Company of Constantinople? Thankfully Skanderbeg, one of our most prominent sons, can use his rank of Janissary Captain to secure our markets preferential treatment by the Ottomans; even better deals at even better prices!"
 alb_second: "Land of Ambushers"
 alb_second_desc: "Such is the geography of Albania, filled with fertile lowlands and hills, surrounded by imposing mountains and rocky terrain. For centuries the Albanian people would hide in those rocky hills when their enemies came. However, our glorious reunification changed it all; no longer would our people run away and hide, no longer would we allow them to destroy our homes and salt our farms. We will lay our traps, place our men, and wait for the enemy to come to us. The Bulgarian armies will boldly march into the valleys and gorges of our home, only to be turned away, retreating home with their tails tucked between their legs.."

 alb_third: "Kingdom of Albania"
 alb_third_desc: "For ages our lands have been divided and ruled by the foreigners. Our people never had the desire or opportunity to create their own state, ruled by Albanians. But the tide of history is changing. As the mighty empires around us fall, and their influence over us dwindles, we have the opportunity to throw off the chains that bind us down and forge our own destiny."
 alb_fourth: "Hit and Run"
 alb_fourth_desc: "Albania is not a particularly large or powerful country. That doesn't mean that we won't fight when foreign invaders come to steal our lands. We have centuries of experience fighting off invaders and a fantastic understanding of how to best use our land's terrain to our advantage when fighting off these invaders. We don't follow traditional military tactics and march our men into valleys to have them face the enemy head on - we take to the hills, confuse the enemy, and ambush their supply chain. Before they realise what’s hit them, we vanish into thin air, waiting for the next time they march into our home!"
 alb_fifth: "Land of the Eagles"
 alb_fifth_desc: "The day when our glorious founder first raised our flag, emblazoned with the double headed eagle, the myth, and our nation, was born. The Black Eagle still flies, and will continue to do so as long as Albania exists."
 alb2_fifth: "Land of the Eagles"
 alb2_fifth_desc: "The day when our glorious founder first raised our flag, emblazoned with the double headed eagle, the myth, and our nation, was born. The Black Eagle still flies, and will continue to do so as long as Albania exists."
 alb_sixth: "Albanian Tolerance"
 alb_sixth_desc: "Our people find themselves at a crossroads of faith. Stuck between Pope and Patriarch, with the followers of Allah hounding us, it is clear we have to align our beliefs to one or the other. Regardless of our decision however, we shouldn’t alienate those who do not follow our course, as regardless of our faith we are all still Albanian above all."
 alb_seventh: "Break The Power Of Princes"
 alb_seventh_desc: "Our Land was divided and ruled by local princes, who were preoccupied with their own advancement. If we want to create a modern state, we must rid ourselves of these princes and impose a single central will and rule to help guide our people towards a brighter future."

# Events #
 ab_albania.1.t: "Timed Mission Unlocked"
 ab_albania.1.d: "We have unlocked the 'Skanderbeg' timed mission. If we manage to gain 60 Army Tradition before the year 1460, we will gain Skanderbeg as a new ruler. If we fail, the mission will be permanently removed from our misison tree."
 ab_albania.2.t: "Timed Mission Failed"
 ab_albania.2.d: "We have failed to complete the 'Skanderbeg' timed mission before the year 1460. The mission will be permanently removed from our mission tree."
 ab_albania.2.a: "Unfortunate"
 ab_albania.3.t: "Skanderbeg" #timed mission reward
 ab_albania.3.d: "An Albanian noble by the name Gjergj 'Skanderbeg' of House Kastrioti, first distinguished himself in the training regiments as an inspiration to those around him. Educated in the Nicaean Military Academy, Gjergj gained experience in several campaigns under the Nicaean banner against the Byzantines, as well as campaigns in Anatolia to consolidate Nicaean hold on the region. After the Nicaeans brokered an unsteady peace deal with the Angelid court, Gjergj returned to his home in Lezhë, where he established the League of Lezhë, a small group of nobles set on achieving Albanian independence. With Albanian independence now achieved - a large part apportioned to him, Gjergj is the highest-ranking officer in the army who is also of noble standing. It is only fitting that he is given the right to rule Albania."
 ab_albania.3.a: "Glory to Albania!"
 ab_albania.5.t: "An offer to buy [4174.GetName]"
 ab_albania.5.d: "With the Bulgarian menace breathing down our neck, we cannot afford to anger the Latin merchants who will no doubt take advantage of the Balkan infighting. The League of Lezhë has gathered enough funds to offer the greedy Doge a suitable price for the province of [4174.GetName]. This will allow us to peacefully regain a seaport and part of our homeland."
 ab_albania.5.a: "Offer them 75 ducats"
 ab_albania.5.c: "Offer them 150 ducats"
 ab_albania.5.de: "Offer them 300 ducats"
 ALB_OFFER_TO_BUY_DURAZZO: "We will send an offer to buy §Y[4174.GetName]§! for §G75§! ¤"
 ALB_OFFER_TO_BUY_DURAZZO_150: "We will send an offer to buy §Y[4174.GetName]§! for §G150§! ¤"
 ALB_OFFER_TO_BUY_DURAZZO_300: "We will send an offer to buy §Y[4174.GetName]§! for §G300§! ¤"
 ab_albania.5.b: "Don't send the offer"
 ALB_OFFER_TO_BUY_DURAZZO_LAST_CHANCE: "We will not have another chance to buy §Y[4174.GetName]§!"
 ab_albania.6.t: "The Albanian offer"
 ab_albania.6.d: "The recent uprising in the state of Albania within the Bulgarian borders has been brought to our attention. The rise of the Bulgarian empire in the eastern Balkans has given pause to all their neighbours. While our mighty navy ensures our island ports are not threatened by the barbaric horde of Bulgars, our only mainland holding in [4174.GetName] will be under threat, from both Albanian rebel incursions and Bulgarian invasions alike. This will be our only chance to make a tidy profit from a piece of land that we will likely be unable to hold in the future."
 ALB_CEDE_DURAZZO_TO_ALBANIA: "We will cede §Y[4174.GetName]§! to §Y[ALB.GetName]§!."
 ab_albania.6.a: "Sell"
 ab_albania.6.b: "Don't sell"
 ab_albania.7.t: "They Accept!"
 ab_albania.7.d: "The Doge of Venice has seen reason, and the writing on the wall. With chaos soon to rain upon the Balkan highlands, they are willing to part with [4174.GetName] for the tidy sum we have offered. All is well, and now we can look to consolidate our forces in the east without fear of an attack from the west."
 ab_albania.7.a: "Nice"
 ab_albania.8.t: "They Refuse!"
 ab_albania.8.d: "The sin of greed is strong with the Venetians, it seems. Aware of our precarious position, it is obvious they are aiming to exploit our weakness and await a better time to take advantage of our war for independence against the Bulgarians. No matter, they will pay for it eventually..."
 ab_albania.8.a: "Damn them!"
 ab_albania.9.t: "A Question of Faith"
 ab_albania.9.d: "With all of Albania proper under our control, the great noble houses of Albania have gathered in the capital to discuss the future of our nation. Since the very beginning, we have been closely aligned with the Eastern Romans and followed the Patriarch in Constantinople, but centuries of Venetian and Frankish influences have resulted in many adopting the rites of the Catholic Church in Rome. Which faction will prevail?"
 ab_albania.9.a: "The Orthodox nobles maintain their position"
 ab_albania.9.b: "The Catholic nobles successfully argue their case"
 ab_albania.10.t: "The Albanian Revolt" #Event for Bulgaria where the player can switch to Albania
 ab_albania.10.d: "The Red Eagle standard has not been seen for half a millennium. The crushing blow dealt by the Bulgars in the 9th century left us a shadow of our former selves, withering in [4174.GetName], only to be finished off by the opportunistic, mercantilist Venetians. As the turn of the mid-15th century approaches, the Balkan powder keg is once more ready to blow; with the Byzantines humiliated by the rising Bulgarian Tsardom, they will be seeking revenge sooner or later. On the other side are the weakened Serbians, who have only gained independence from Bulgar rule for little over a century yet suffered defeat twice under the combined might of other Slavs and are eager to seek allies. While the Bulgarians are suitably occupied by war against their old foes, the Albanian volunteers will need to be well-trained in order to resist a large and daunting force and secure independence. Even more importantly, they will need a great leader to command them to victory."
 ab_albania.10.a: "Such a pitiful state is doomed to fail again." #stay bulgaria
 ab_albania.10.b: "Let us embrace the old Illyrian ways once more!" #switch
 ab_albania.11.t: "Illyria Reborn" #reward of Illyria Reborn mission
 ab_albania.11.d: "The legacy of Illyria is known to all who live in the Balkans. As one of the first large groups of people to inhabit the region, alongside the Thracians and the Greeks, the Illyrian identity spans across the majority of the western highlands that form the spine of the Balkans and oversees the Adriatic. Although most of the Illyrian customs have been lost during the chaos of the Dark Ages, some are still preserved by word of mouth. They were a strong seafaring people with a predilection to pirate merchant fleets, seen as unpredictable, turbulent and warlike by the Greco-Romans. With emerging threats from all sides, this is perhaps a reputation that we could use to our advantage. In any case, the Illyrian identity is one that only we, of the Albanian people, can truly reclaim."
 ab_albania.11.a: "Illustrious Illyria!"
 ab_albania.12.t: "Heirs of the Romans" #Conquest of Constantinople
 ab_albania.12.d: "Byzantine Greek culture was the most prevalent during our time under subjugation by different overlords, adopting their governing style, inheriting many traditions and military administration. As of this day, the Albanian identity has had a resurgence, while the repeated expeditions by the Bulgars, Venetians and Nicaeans into Byzantine lands have left them devastated and bankrupt. Although Albania has not assimilated with the Byzantine Greek identity and instead chose to pursue another, more enlightened path, we still remain the best successors to the legacy of the Romans. Our troops marching across Greece are welcomed as liberators, scenes of jubilation a commonality everywhere they go. With Constantinople now under Albanian control and our claims to the region validated by the Patriarchate of Constantinople, we inherit the heirship of the Roman legacy. "
 ab_albania.12.a: "Ave!"
 ab_albania.13.t: "The League of Lezhe"
 ab_albania.13.d: "Never in history have the Albanian people stood as one as we do now, and so the great noble houses have convened to elect a leader from their ranks. Each family brings their own particular expertise to the table. Who shall be chosen?"
 ab_albania.13.a: "The great generals of the Kastrioti!"
 ab_albania.13.b: "The merchants of the Zaharia!"
 ab_albania.13.c: "The well-connected Thopians!"
 ab_albania.13.de: "The storied Arianites!"
 ab_albania.14.t: "The Latin Empire" #final mission of the Catholic branch 
 ab_albania.14.d: "The worthy task of the crusaders was not in vain; their princes showed us the truth, and their warriors protected the feeble light of our gens, now a fire of fervor engulfing the houses of the Orthodox traitors. The Roman Phoenix is now reforged from this light, and finally do Latins march against the traitorous patriarchies; the Fourth Crusade is finally over, and the spirits of the crusaders can rest."
 ab_albania.14.a: "One banner, one nation, one religion."

While the Bulgarians are suitably occupied, the Albanian volunteers will need to be well-trained in order to resist a large and daunting force and secure independence." #4174 is Durres
 alb_greater_title: "Greater Albania"
 alb_greater_desc: "As we have established a stable foothold along the western highlands of the Balkan peninsula, the Albanians living as minorities outside Albania proper from the times of Illyria are now flocking to us in droves. Many will support our cause, by joining the military or assisting in gaining footholds across the Balkans."
 alb_heir_title: "Heirs of the Romans"
 alb_heir_desc: "Byzantine Greek culture was the most prevalent during our time under subjugation by different overlords, adopting their governing style, inheriting many traditions and military administration. As of this day, the Albanian identity has had a resurgence, while the repeated expeditions by the Bulgars, Venetians and Nicaeans into Byzantine lands have left them devastated and bankrupt. It is time Greece be put under new, revitalised ownership."
 alb_greece_title: "Invade Greece"
 alb_greece_desc: "With Greece divided between many different administrations, their people have been unable to mount a proper resistance against their subjugators. The Arvanites, Albanians living in Greece and assimilating into the local culture have especially lent their aid as reconnaissance units. Let us aid them and liberate Greece from foreign hands."
 alb_aegean_title: "Aegean Domination"
 alb_aegean_desc: "The Aegean Sea is home to one of the ancient trade routes of the Silk Road; either to reach Constantinople or to continue onwards towards Italian ports. By controlling both sides of the Aegean through the Archipelagos Islands and their ports, we can launch patrol fleets against piracy, control a large share of trade and enrich the royal coffers immensely."
 alb_slavs_title: "Strike Against the Slavs"
 alb_slavs_desc: "The Slavic Kingdoms surrounding us have controlled the Balkans for far too long. With the Byzantines a distant memory, we are the last stronghold standing against the expansionist Bulgarians. While they are occupied with consolidating their hold over their newly occupied lands, let us march along the Danube and raze their heartland!"
 alb_western_title: "Control West Balkans"
 alb_western_desc: "The Croats to our north still conspire with the Latins and Franks to destroy us. We will not let them sell their eternal souls for trivial worldly politics! They must be shown the light, even if by force."
 alb_romania_title: "Cross the Danube"
 alb_romania_desc: "The Romanian Vlachs and Moldovans remain one of the most strange cultures in the region. Their language and culture are closer to that of Latin and other Romance offshoots over the dominant Slavic identity in Eastern Europe, isolating them from the majority of their neighbours. The fertile farmlands are irrigated by the Danube River, which also presents itself as a natural defence line against northern incursions. Romania is an ideal region for Albania to expand into and develop in the future."
 alb_military_title: "Military Revitalization"
 alb_military_desc: "If we are to unshackle ourselves from being a minor pawn in the battle for control of the Balkans, we must recruit and reform our army into a much more intimidating force. Let us take in all able volunteers, and supplement them with local mercenaries to revitalise the Albanian army!"
 alb_eagle_title: "The Eagle Flies Again"
 alb_eagle_desc: "The numerous wars waged across the Balkans have given the Albanian military administration precious experience in fighting much larger forces with a smaller, compact army. Even as we expand our army and are no longer fighting more numerous foes, that knowledge has encouraged a new way of thinking; in establishing a more disciplined, professional fighting force."
 alb_rebuild_title: "Rebuild Albania"
 alb_rebuild_desc: "With the horrors of war behind us, we can now turn towards recovering and rebuilding what was lost."
 alb_navy_title: "Forca Detare"
 alb_navy_desc: "With the majority of the western Balkans being rugged terrain and full of treacherous mountain fortifications, land invasions from the north under the threat of the Germans and Italians are almost impossible. On the other hand, the ports along the Adriatic Sea are prime naval invasion targets for the large navies employed by the Italian merchant states. We must counteract this threat by building our own naval flotilla, a Forca Detare."
 alb_countryside_title: "Develop the Countryside"
 alb_countryside_desc: "The hinterlands of our nation, while idyllic, are impoverished and largely empty. We should settle these lands and make use of their potential."
 alb_cities_title: "Build New Cities"
 alb_cities_desc: "Us Albanians have long been pastoralists, herders, and farmers. But as our enemies have taught us, we require more than that: we need merchants, armourers, and scholars, but in order to cultivate such people we need cities so their skills can be put to use."
 alb_identity_title: "Promote Our Identity"
 alb_identity_desc: "To the glee of our enemies, we have never been a unified people. We have been pulled back and forth between Romans, Greeks, Franks, and Venetians, all for the hope of holding a meagre position of power just maybe one year longer. But with our newfound success, and perhaps some pressure of our own, we can unite the fractured principalities of our nation behind one cause: for that of an Albanian nation!"
 alb_progenitors_title: "Balkan Progenitors"
 alb_progenitors_desc: "Before the Slavs, before the Magyars and Vlachs, were the Illyrians. We alone carry forth their legacy as the first masters of the Balkans; let us reunite the ancient Kingdom."
 alb_trade_title: "Expand the Trade Network"
 alb_trade_desc: "With the situation stabilising across our land borders, it is time to look to the sea and manage the trade routes and their merchant ships. Many carry premium wares, and if we can encourage them to stop at our ports, it can only bring wealth."
 alb_ottomans_title: "Deals with the Ottomans"
 alb_ottomans_desc: "Striking deals with merchants is always an enormous pain - especially with one as established as the Osmans & Sons Co., the Byzantine court deigning them the honour of their own, dedicated Bazaar in the heart of [151.GetName]. A trade empire headed by the Osman family and their retainers, they hire the most cutthroat merchants, and the mercenary groups to match. Only when Osman's Bazaar has been reopened will they deem us worthy to trade with. If they don't, we can introduce them to a little thing called A Sultan Battery..."
 alb_balkan_dominate_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB]Balkan Domination[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB_end]"
 alb_balkan_dominate_desc: "With full control established over the entirety of the Balkans, the Illyrian legacy has now been fulfilled. As the great power of Eastern Europe, cultural dominance over the Slavs across the Balkans is now bearing fruit, and they are now more willing to adopt the enlightened Illyrian traditions and customs."
 alb_pannonia_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB]Control Pannonia[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB_end]"
 alb_pannonia_desc: "The Magyars of Carpathia are a plague upon Eastern Europe. Originally migrating from the east, they ravaged the countryside wherever they traversed, at the apparent behest of their bloody sky gods. It was only until they were brutalised by the similarly migrating Bulgars that they somewhat calmed their destructive tendencies. Even now, they are an eyesore. Christians and other Pagans alike would love to see them destroyed - and we shall happily take their fertile lands for ourselves."
 alb_illyria_reborn_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB]Illyria Reborn[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB_end]"
 alb_illyria_reborn_desc: "We are a people accustomed to hardship. We have faced extermination for over a millennium, and yet still carried on in the face of Romans, Slavs, and Greeks. And now, for the first time, our future is bright. We have finally reclaimed what was lost so many centuries ago, and we can now say with certainty: Long live Illyria!"
 alb_elect_title: "Elect a Leader"
 alb_elect_desc: "With the existence of our people at stake, we must put aside our petty differences and elect one from our own to lead us to victory."
 alb_rally_title: "Rally the Nation"
 alb_rally_desc: "We stand now at the precipice of extinction, our very identity at risk of being lost forever. No more! We must rise as one and fight for our future."
 alb_support_title: "Find Supporters"
 alb_support_desc: "The arrogant Bulgars have made many enemies among the other European powers. We should send ambassadors out to see if any would be willing to assist our cause."
 alb_homeland_title: "Liberate the Homeland"
 alb_homeland_desc: "Against all odds, we have managed to banish Bulgarian and Latin forces from our homeland and secure our independence. But our work will not be done until every one of our people has been liberated."
 alb_faith_title: "A Question of Faith"
 alb_faith_desc: "With all of Albania proper under our control, the great noble houses of Albania have gathered in the capital to discuss the future of our nation. Since the very beginning, we have been closely aligned with the Eastern Romans and followed the Patriarch in Constantinople, but centuries of Venetian and Frankish influences have resulted in many adopting the rites of the Catholic Church in Rome. Which faction will prevail?"
 ALB_UNLOCKABLE2: "You can unlock this mission by completing the '§YQuestion of Faith§!' mission."
 alb_embrace_new_faith_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB]Embrace Catholicism[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB_end]"
 alb_embrace_new_faith_desc: "The Roman Orthodox Church has never been in such disunity. The Kievan Rus suffered a death by a thousand cuts, shattering against the onslaught of the Golden Horde. Meanwhile, the former Patriarchate of Bulgaria now sits from a position of strength, estranged from the head in Constantinople, with the Patriarchates of Alexandria, Jerusalem and Antioch entirely out of reach. Centuries have passed, yet Orthodox believers have had little time to focus on matters of faith. Attempts to bring Catholicism to the Balkans have met with scorn and disdain - though that may be Venetian avarice and their traitorous character. If we were to embrace this new faith, we could potentially wield enormous power within the clerical circles in Eastern Europe as the bastion of Catholicism."
 alb_catholic_alliances_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB]Catholic Confraternity[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB_end]"
 alb_catholic_alliances_desc: "The Catholic cause is only as strong as its weakest links - a single dim-witted individual can bring down the entire faith and its regional presence. The Battle of Valencia is evidence enough of this; Catholicism in Eastern Europe can only persist with our strength at the helm. The Papal States are too busy dealing with a Mad King and the shadow of Sicily, while we can consider neither the Venetians nor Genoans can for such a responsibility, what with their propensity to sell the True Cross rather than worship it - but they have their uses..."
 alb_latin_empire_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB]Proclaim the Latin Empire[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB_end]"
 alb_latin_empire_desc: "The Latin Empire once had a strong presence across the Mediterranean. Nizzarid militarisation hindered Catholic presence in Alexandria and now threatens an Islamic takeover of the Holy City of Jerusalem. Before we can even imagine landing in Asia Minor to relieve the Crusader states from impending doom, we must deal with the Schism besetting this side of the Aegean. The Patriarchate of Constantinople holds significant power in the region, and if we convince them to accept Catholicism once and for all, we can settle the religious conflict permanently."

While there is no one single cause for the collapse of the Empire, there is one family that keeps pushing the empire closer and closer towards total destruction, albeit unintentionally. The Angelos dynasty, which has been ruling over Byzantium since the 12th Century, have showcased the military incompetence, corruption, overspending, and a complete disregard for state maintenance that the Byzantine Empire has come to be known for. If Byzantium is to survive the centuries to coming, they must rebuild their broken state, reform their military, and prevent further incursions from rivals, lest they fall just as the west did.\n\nYou can lower your §YDecadence§! level by completing mission in the §YAngelid Crisis§! mission tree branch.\n"

# The Phoenix Prince #
# Howard: This is Patreon immortalization, the Pheonix is intended
 ab_the_pheonix_prince.1.t: "The Birth of a Pheonix"
 ab_the_pheonix_prince.1.d: "Years ago, the Byzantine Empire and the Serbian principality were unfortunate allies, standing together against the Bulgarian menace. However, Bulgarian forces emerged victorious, shattering the alliance and leaving both Byzantium and Serbia significantly weaker. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Ioannes II of Byzantium, burdened by the weight of his crumbling empire and the absence of an heir, recognized the need to reestablish the Serbo-Byzantine alliance. He cast his gaze northward, to the Serbian lands, where Princess  [Root.Consort.GetName] was known for her wisdom and grace. Their marriage was a strategic decision, a pact to mend the frayed ties between their realms. It was a union rooted in diplomacy, but beneath the political calculations, a genuine bond began to form between the royal couple. Despite the years that passed, their hope for an heir remained unfulfilled, casting a shadow over the empire's future.\n\nIt is a clear night, and the stars above shine brilliantly, as if the heavens themselves are watching over the city. But then, an extraordinary event starts to unfold. High above, the sky bursts into a spectacular meteor shower, streaks of light and fire trailing across the celestial canvas. As the meteors continue to streak across the sky, in the great palace of Constantinople, the prayers of  [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Ioannes and [Root.Consort.GetTitle]  [Root.Consort.GetName] are finally answered. After a gruelling long pregnancy [Root.Consort.GetTitle]  [Root.Consort.GetName], her eyes reflecting the brilliance of the celestial display outside, finally gives birth to a son.\n\nThe palace is filled with joy, and the news spreads through the city like wildfire. Bells ring out in celebration, and the people, under the meteor shower above, rejoice in the birth of their future ruler. The child, born on this blessed night under the light of the falling stars, is named Alexios. It is seen as a sign, a union of destiny and the heavens. Alexios will grow to be a symbol of hope and renewal, the phoenix, a beacon of promise for the Byzantine Empire, which longs for a future bathed in the light of a new era. "
 ab_the_pheonix_prince.1.a: "A ruler to guide us into a new era surely…?"
 ab_the_pheonix_prince.1.b: "Exile him to Serbia!"
 BYZ_PHEONIX_PRINCE_BIRTH: "The child has a great destiny ahead of him... if he survives long enough..."
 ab_the_pheonix_prince.2.t: "Pheonix Ascendant"
 ab_the_pheonix_prince.2.d: "Alexios Angelos of the Byzantine Empire grew up to embody everything his Angelid ancestors had failed to be. He was a young man driven by an insatiable thirst for all matters concerning rulership. While most of his peers were occupied with pursuits of leisure, he was deeply invested in the arts of warfare and statecraft. He could often be found engrossed in discussions with seasoned generals and advisors, meticulously studying historical records of efficient bureaucracies, immersing himself in the art of diplomacy, poring over battle maps, and thoroughly examining military treatises. His days followed a routine of rigorous physical and mental training. He relentlessly drilled alongside his soldiers, pushing his limits in combat exercises. His proficiency with a sword and his ability to lead by example were renowned throughout the empire.\n\nHis true potential shone brightest in the war room, surrounded by maps, scrolls, and tactical diagrams, where he crafted intricate battle plans. Like the great imperial commanders of the past, he possessed a rare gift for visualising the ebb and flow of a battle, anticipating enemy movements, and exploiting weaknesses.\n\nWhile he was a devoted military strategist, he also had a unique bond with his Serbian mother and her homeland. In private, he cherished the traditions and heritage of Serbia, quietly practising customs passed down through his maternal lineage. His mother's stories of Serbia's history and martial traditions, though less refined than Byzantine ones, nevertheless left a lasting imprint on him. However, his strong attachment to Serbian culture occasionally made him appear aloof or distant from his Byzantine peers, contributing to a sense of isolation within the imperial court.\n\nThis familial connection inspired him to experiment with the incorporation of Serbian military tactics into the Byzantine arsenal. Drawing from the rich martial heritage of both cultures, he sought to meld the strengths of Serbian warfare with Byzantine strategies, creating a distinctive blend that set him apart as a forward-thinking commander. This fusion of traditions not only reinforced his deep connection to his Serbian heritage but also enriched the Byzantine military, providing an innovative edge on the battlefield.\n\nAs word of his unparalleled expertise in warfare spread, he earned the reverence and envy of Byzantium's most seasoned generals. However, within the imperial court, he faced a unique challenge. Some among the courtiers harboured lingering distrust toward him, associating him with the memory of the late rebel leader, Leon Gabras."
 ab_the_pheonix_prince.2.a: "Give him command of the army, he shall lead from the front!"
 ab_the_pheonix_prince.2.b: "It is too dangerous, we can't risk losing him."
 ab_the_pheonix_prince.2.c: "Our army already shows improvement."
 BYZ_PHEONIX_PRINCE_GENERAL: "Alexios shall be given direct command of an army, letting him use his skills to the full but also risking his life"
 BYZ_PHEONIX_PRINCE_NO_GENERAL: "For now he shall stay far from the battlefield, commanding the armies from a safe place"
