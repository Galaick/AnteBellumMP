Under their banner, tides of German settlement has befallen the region. As a result of this, the question of membership in the Holy Roman Empire has repeatedly arisen. Our advisors urge us to heed caution in the matter, for the Knights have not always held the purest of intentions - some whisper that ambitious characters within the Knighthood may unlawfully lay claim to territory within the empire itself, should they be admitted."

However, the realisation has dawned on us that we will never find something holy and pure in these horrid wastes - we will have to forge and create it ourselves, and hone our hardiness against the brutality of the steppe.

 teuton_event.1.a: "Send an envoy to Rome"
 teuton_event.2.t: "Order of the Cross"
 teuton_event.2.d: "An envoy from [From.GetName] just arrived, asking for an audience with His Holiness. He came in order to ask for a permission to establish a knigthly order which would serve the Christ and turn the Pagan Baltic natives to true faith."
 teuton_event.2.a: "Give them permission!"

 teuton_event.3.a: "Deus Vult"
 teuton_event.4.t: "Hansa and the Order"
 teuton_event.4.d: "Before our arrival on the treacherous Baltic shores, the Hanseatic League was the bastion of Christian civilisation in the region. Protecting Christian mercantile order, navigating unholy quagmires (both literal and diplomatic), bitterly defending German frontiers - they have much in common with our own intentions, save a certain penchant for money and seafaring. That being said, the question now arises - what place does the League have in our new Baltic order? Should we retain relations, or relegate them to the dust-bin of history?"
 teuton_event.4.a: "We should renew these relations indeed."
 teuton_event.4.b: "Our relationship with the Hansa ended with the formation of the Order."
 teuton_event.5.t: "The Reyse of the Knights"
 teuton_event.5.d: "The Reyse, the seasonal campaign conducted against noted wickedness, has come at last. From across Europe, warriors young and old and have ventured to our holdings in hearty glee, seeking camaraderie, training, apprenticeship, coin, friends, food, and of course, ale. On this fine day, a multitude of tongues, ranging from Gaelic to German, have swarmed the sunny hillsides, eager to partake in the knightly tradition, to prove, test and sharpen their mettle by means of joust, spar and boast. Our hearts and our banners swell with pride, seeing our mission respected and adored - as well as provided with fresh blood."

 teuton_event.6.t: "Hussite Downfall"
 teuton_event.6.d: "At last, the downfall of the dreaded followers of Jan Hus is at hand. A heretical blight has tarnished Bohemia for too long - the streets of Prague rife with unholy activity, at which many a Pope has raged against from afar, in vain. No longer - by the sword, we have corrected the down-going of the Czechs."
 teuton_event.6.a: "May they never go astray again."
 teuton_event.7.t: "The Baltic and the Empire"
 teuton_event.7.d: "Our mission has blazed bright with success, ordained by God's grace. From the shores of the Baltic to the fields of Poland, we have gathered land for ourselves, vanquished heathens, and bestowed settlers. As a result, we've cropped up against the frontiers we once pledged diligently to defend - finding ourselves to be the foreigners on the other side, no longer the esteemed protectors. Is it time now to join with our German brothers in Christ - for a more stable, cohesive realm? Or shall we forge our own destiny, turning our gaze firmly eastwards?"

 teuton_event.10.b: "Regulations? We shall not be ordered by anybody!"
 teuton_event.11.t: "The Emperor Rejects Us"
 teuton_event.11.d: "Despite our best diplomatic attempt, the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire sees no reason to let us join the Empire. We are on our own against the infidels..."
 teuton_event.11.a: "Did they at least tell us why?"
 teuton_event.12.t: "Illegal War in the Empire"
 teuton_event.12.d: "We joined the Holy Roman Empire under the premise that we only need protection from the infidels, and the Emperor granted us this protection with the promise that we would not excercise warfare within the Empire. Today, we broke this promise.\nThe Emperor exiled us from the Empire, and sees our war as an act of aggression against the Imperial Crown itself."
 teuton_event.12.a: "Brace ourselves! The Imperial Army is coming!"
 teuton_event.13.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Legal System"
 teuton_event.13.d: "As our [Root.GovernmentName] has expanded and aged the complexity and extent of overlapping and often inconsistent legal practices has grown out of all control. Legal cases are decided by local, often privately employed, judges according to rules that differ so much from case to case that it is impossible to guarantee any form of legal certainty. Some courts are rendered impotent by a maze of feudal, imperial and traditional jurisdictions while others see judges make a fortune by corrupting the authority of our laws.\nNonetheless, the education institutions of our state have produced a great number of legal minds and scholars. It is time we put them to use planning a new, uniform and consistent and well-regulated legal system for our state. Let us reform the [Root.GetAdjective] courts to ensure efficient handling of litigation, impartial judges paid for by the state and hired based on merit, a reduction of overlapping jurisdictions and a clear hierarchy of appeals."
 teuton_event.13.a: "Yes! Start in God's name!"
 teuton_event.14.t: "University of Königsberg"
 teuton_event.14.d: "What feels like an eternity has passed since Königsberg was but a humble settlement, forged from the ashes of some hideous pagan rump. Swamps have been swept aside, moats have been dug and nature itself has been tamed - a metropolis, thoroughly German, purely Christian, has arisen and stands tall. It is only befitting that a centre of learning, with which wise men may be forged and tested, should also arise, so that it is truly a city worthy of respect. Many scholars, from near and afar, have at last petitioned us to formalise and sponsor a university in the heart of the city."
 teuton_event.14.a: "Sponsor the University."
 teuton_event.15.t: "The Future of the Order"
 teuton_event.15.d: "The time comes now for us to look to the future. The longer the years wear on, the greater the questions grow - what shall our mission become? Who will the next enemy of Christianity be? How shall our administration grow? What truly makes a knight? Though these concerns may mount, our confidence does not waver. We have the blessing of God - we will endure the ages to come and be as instrumental to the world as the powers of old."
 teuton_event.15.a: "Deus Vult!" 
 teuton_event.18.t: "Formation of a Crusader Order"
 teuton_event.18.d: "With our successive achievements of our conquest, the administration of our realm is getting more and more exhausting for the order. It is clear that we are no longer a purely monastic order which hides in monasteries. We are an order on a Holy Mission to bring Catholicism to Northern Europe.\nBut for our goals we have to reform our limiting rules of the order."
 teuton_event.18.a: "Let us reform into a Crusader Order, so that everyone knows what our mission is!"
 teuton_event.20.t: "Reform of the [Root.GetAdjective] Army"
 teuton_event.20.d: "To say that war has changed would be an understatement. From the composition of armies to the means of supplying vital goods, the centuries have seen the rapid advancement of new ideas, as well as the prompt abandonment of others. Where this has not been the case, many an ailing nation has seen its ruin - torn asunder by the armies of those wiser and warier. We know better than to fall prey to this cruelty - we have worked diligently to maintain professionalism, research new technologies and hone our tactics. All this effort has coalesced into a complete reform that has been decades in the making."
 teuton_event.20.a: "Be it by blade or gun - victory shall be ours."
 teuton_event.21.t: "The End of Roman Legacy"
 teuton_event.21.d: "All things must come to an end. Powers, governments, unions, cultures - they rise and fall, bringing with them new advancements and ideas to the world, before returning to the nothingness from whence they came. As we have risen to prominence, we've found ourselves eclipsing powers and legacies once thought eternal. Even that of the Roman legacy - a tangled, ever-changing abstract designed to suit whoever has decided to claim it - has been relegated, at last, to the history books, arguably by our hand, and perhaps even by God's will."
 teuton_event.21.a: "Farewell."
 teuton_event.22.t: "Crusaders of the Steppes"
 teuton_event.22.d: "After subduing the likes of Ruthenia and ushering the eastern Slavs into our fold, we have found that the heretical likes of Orthodoxy were not simply a blight to be corrected, but an unruly reaction - a myriad of idolatry which the Slavic peoples clung to, driven by the pure terror of what lurked beyond the eastern horizon. From beyond the Caspian, many a horror has ridden forth - the Mongols, of recent note, as well as perhaps even ancient Attila himself. It has become apparent to us now that our true destiny was not to simply liberate the Baltic, but to also vanquish the evils of the steppe - to make it a heartland of Christianity, just as Francia and Italy were once illuminated by God's name. "
 teuton_event.22.a: "Set forth!"

# Missions #
 teu_improve_diplomacy_title: "Improve Diplomacy"
 teu_improve_diplomacy_desc: "Our current position is too perilous for us to stand alone. We must sharpen not only our swords, but our tongues too, if we hope to be taken seriously!"
 teu_find_strong_allies_title: "Find Strong Allies"
 teu_find_strong_allies_desc: "With our newfound diplomatic wit, we must seek out allies abroad. In a world of heathen treachery, there is no such thing as having too many friends."
 teu_swedish_resolution_title: "Swedish Resolution"
 teu_swedish_resolution_desc: "The Swedes have done well to embrace the light of Christ. However, they may very well become as unruly and unpredictable as the likes of the Franks. We must either take them into our benevolent fold or ensure they remain of a similar persuasion to us for the foreseeable future."
 teu_develop_prussia_title: "Develop Prussia"
 teu_develop_prussia_desc: "Having laid claim to these lands, it is only right that we oversee their development. A myriad of marshes blot the landscape and the shorelines are rather unstable and untrustworthy. Dikes, canals and other infrastructure must be sponsored if people are to find this land attractive."
 teu_expand_army_title: "Expand the Army"
 teu_expand_army_desc: "Gone are the days of being but a humble organisation of knights. If we are to wield the righteous fist of God, then we must have the right number of men to carry it! It's rather heavy."

 teu_the_livonian_confederacy_title: "The Livonian Confederacy"
 teu_the_livonian_confederacy_desc: "To the northeast, the more frigid corners of the Baltic await. Our knights yearn for deeper incursions into these hinterlands. By this will and our growing array of means, we may grant them this wish and even permit them a new confederacy."
 teu_fortify_livonia_title: "Fortify Livonia"
 teu_fortify_livonia_desc: "Having laid claim to Livonia, we must now fortify it. From beyond its borders, as well as within, it faces threats from heathens and heretics alike. To prevent this new holding from slipping through our fingers, we must harden it."
 teu_push_back_title: "Push Back the Heathens"
 teu_push_back_desc: "We have a foothold! We cannot let this chance slip. The heathens must be vanquished, shown the error of their ways, before we are the ones being pushed back."
 teu_order_of_the_cross_title: "Order of the Cross"
 teu_order_of_the_cross_desc: "With our newfound strength and rapidly rising numbers, we may soon acquire approval and even sponsorship from the Pope himself. To do battle against the heathen hordes, we need all the divine ordinance we can get. Deus Vult!"
 teu_a_competent_cabinet_title: "A Competent Cabinet"
 teu_a_competent_cabinet_desc: "If we are to be taken seriously as a nation, we must have about ourselves a plethora of advisors who know exactly what they are doing. Gone are the days of being but a simple fledgling realm - we require a strong and proficient government!"
 teu_university_of_konigsberg_title: "University of Königsberg"
 teu_university_of_konigsberg_desc: "Scholars have been clamouring for us to found a university proper within our borders. Within the newly-founded city of Königsberg, a contingency of local monks and learned men have been spearheading an effort to see it founded near the city centre. With our resources, their dream could become a reality."
 teu_state_diet_title: "Establish the State Diet"
 teu_state_diet_desc: "No state is worthy without a diet! We must convene, regularly, on matters not only national, but local, too."
 teu_reform_the_state_title: "Reform the State"
 teu_reform_the_state_desc: "The long-awaited time has come for us to deliberate over reforming our administration. Gone are the days of simple crusades. We have a burgeoning population of peasants, merchants, and nobles, not simply knights and unruly settlers. To handle our realm's burdens better, we must expand and streamline our means of administration."
 teu_found_the_navy_title: "Found the [Root.GetAdjective] Navy"
 teu_found_the_navy_desc: "To our north, the frigid Baltic awaits. Many a rival, both near and far, seek to assert dominance over not only its lanes of commerce, but also its vital ports. If we are to have a chance at dominating the Baltic, we must found a navy worthy of respect - and fear."
 teu_contest_with_hansa_title: "Compete with Hansa"
 teu_contest_with_hansa_desc: "The Hansa, a worthy and respectable commercial power in its own right, has for decades been a leader in mercantile matters - as well as our guarantor of prosperity. Now we see a chance to not only compete, but eclipse them - seize reputation and coin alike for ourselves."
 teu_protect_the_baltic_trade_title: "Protect the Baltic Trade"
 teu_protect_the_baltic_trade_desc: "Now that we have eclipsed the Hansa as the trading power of the Baltic, we must take responsibility. It is only right that all merchants, big and small, feel safe sailing through our waters."
 teu_imperial_protection_title: "Seek Imperial Protection"
 teu_imperial_protection_desc: "Just to the southwest, the Holy Roman Empire rages on - a long-standing Christian frontier against heathen incursions. Our advisors have long ruminated on whether or not we should seek Imperial protection outright. Some even will us to forget about them - to forge an empire of our own to the east."
 teu_secure_pomerania_title: "Secure Pomerania"
 teu_secure_pomerania_desc: "To the west, the Pomeranians remain a thoroughly ignorant bunch. If only they knew the light of God, they would perhaps make good subjects. Let us bring to them the good word!"
 teu_baptize_wendia_title: "Baptize Wendia"
 teu_baptize_wendia_desc: "Wendia has proven not only a treacherous borderland, but also a heartland of wickedness. The heathens of Wendia stubbornly cling to their strange ways, wishing to outlast and banish Christ from the cold north. We must put a stop to them at last!"
 teu_break_the_danes_title: "Break the Danes"
 teu_break_the_danes_desc: "The Danes have long been a thorn in the side of Christian Europe. For centuries, the Vikings have terrorised the shorelines of many an innocent Christian king. At last, we have a chance of setting them on the straight and narrow - as well as claiming some vital land for ourselves!"
 teu_eagle_of_the_seas_title: "The Eagle of the Seas"
 teu_eagle_of_the_seas_desc: "With our newfound dominance over the gates to the Baltic Sea, it is only right that we capitalise! Our navy must dominate the region. No one can rival us!"
 teu_unite_piasts_title: "Unite with the Piasts"
 teu_unite_piasts_desc: "Long ago, a Polish king saw the light of Christ. He pledged himself to spreading the good word, but before he could complete his mission, the unenlightened mob at his heels rose up in ignorant defiance. In the years since, Poland has become fragmented. We must step in and rectify this affair!"
 teu_lechitic_conquest_title: "Lechitic Conquest"
 teu_lechitic_conquest_desc: "With a foothold in Poland established and the traditional Piast lands integrated into our realm, we can now conquer the region outright! The Polish people yearn for unification and stability. We must free them from the heathen treachery!"
 teu_salt_mine_title: "Wieliczka Salt Mine"
 teu_salt_mine_desc: "Delicious rivers of salt run rich beneath the earth of a locality known to the locals as Wieliczka. We can share this salt with all of Europe should we invest in their mining capabilities!" 
 teu_answer_reformation_title: "Answer the Reformation"
 teu_answer_reformation_desc: "In a time of growing uncertainty, we must decide where we stand on theological matters. Will we stand with the Pope as we always have? Or shall we look to Christ more closely, setting aside seemingly obsolete practices?"
 teu_complete_crusade_title: "Complete the Crusade"
 teu_complete_crusade_desc: "A great opportunity now stands before us - the possibility of at last completing the crusade. The Baltic, within our lifetime, could very well fall entirely beneath God's banner. As well as ours!"
 teu_christianize_baltic_title: "Christianize Baltic"
 teu_christianize_baltic_desc: "With the Baltic within our grasp, it is now time for us to dispense Christ's grace! We must baptise the ignorant masses of the region and bring them into Christendom's fold."
 teu_secure_gap_title: "Secure the Gap"
 teu_secure_gap_desc: "With our flank secured and our lands baptised, we must look to Podlasie. A frontier awaits us there, dividing our newly-acquired lands and the likes of White Russia. We must bring the gap under our control."
 teu_cross_gulf_title: "Cross the Gulf"
 teu_cross_gulf_desc: "Across the frigid waters of Ingria, the looming pines of Finland await. Within, heathen tribes have long lurked, defiant of Christ's grace. Previous attempts, most notably by the Swedes, to pacify the region have gone to waste. We must rectify their unsatisfactory performance and get the job done properly."
 teu_purge_suomenusko_title: "Purge Suomenusko"
 teu_purge_suomenusko_desc: "The Sapmi of the far north remain bitterly hostile towards the grace of Christendom. For the security of our own borders, as well as their souls, we must subdue their unruly hearts."
 teu_end_vikings_title: "End the Vikings"
 teu_end_vikings_desc: "At last, there stands the opportunity to eradicate the Viking scourge. Christ has bountiful forgiveness to offer - he knows that the people of Scandinavia may still be turned to the light. It is our mission that we bring these people to God and free Europe from the malevolence of the Norse pantheon."
 teu_unknown_frontier_title: "The Unknown Frontier"
 teu_unknown_frontier_desc: "Far, far away, the Norse have dared to set foot upon glaciers which only the most ignorant of heathens have previously occupied. Via their freshly-acquired wisdom, bravery and sailing routes, we may follow in their footsteps and penetrate this shadowy north - illuminating it forevermore."
 teu_shield_of_empire_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Shield of the Empire[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_shield_of_empire_desc: "We must stand not only as a shield for Christendom, but as a shield for the Empire, too! For as long as people dare turn their back on God, the people of the Empire will not be safe. It is our duty to protect them!"
 teu_counter_reformation_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Counter Reformation[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"

 teu_imperium_romanum_desc: "With all that we have done for the Empire, it is only right that it appreciates us for our efforts! Let us grace the electors with our charisma."
 teu_prussian_emperor_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]A Prussian Emperor[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_prussian_emperor_desc: "With the electors sufficiently charmed, it is time that the crown passes to our brow! Only then will the Empire truly be safe and prosperous."
 teu_kingdom_of_hungary_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Kingdom of Hungary[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_kingdom_of_hungary_desc: "For centuries, the Carpathian Basin has been tormented. In a state of turmoil, migration after migration has ruined its peaceful pastures and magnificent mountains. With its potential squandered, it has never amounted to anything and has even entertained wicked heresies. Let's set the record straight!"
 teu_emperor_of_east_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Emperor of the East[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_emperor_of_east_desc: "Beyond the plains of Poland and the barbary of the Baltic, new unclaimed lands await us east! Yes, some unruly Orthodox heretics and steppe marauders may have set up little rump states and 'kingdoms', but who cares! God wills it."
 teu_professional_army_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Professional Army[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_professional_army_desc: "We are no nation without a professional standing army! Gone are the days of dirty peasant conscripts. Men, much like the weapons they wield, must be hardened, sharpened and perfected!"
 teu_army_reforms_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Army Reforms[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_army_reforms_desc: "The current era burgeons with complexity. It feels that every decade, a new advancement rocks the battlefield. We would be foolish to fall behind the latest developments. In fact, we must reform our army so that our standards are maintained and assimilate whatever new technologies we can manufacture."
 teu_army_with_a_state_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]An Army with a State[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_army_with_a_state_desc: "When we were first embarking upon our crusade as a humble fledgling state, we were truly a band of warriors. It seems things never change. Though we have empowered and streamlined our state as much as necessary, our army has taken priority. It is only right that we embrace this state of affairs."
 teu_rule_the_saxons_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Rule the Saxons[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_rule_the_saxons_desc: "The Saxons have known disunity, treachery, heresy and foreign conquest for far too long. Under our banner, they will prosper eternally!"
 teu_heart_of_germany_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Heart of Germany[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_heart_of_germany_desc: "Germany proper must be rendered unto our fold. It will never be safe so long as it remains a disunited heap of manure. We must claim Germany for ourselves!"
 teu_blood_and_iron_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Blood and Iron[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_blood_and_iron_desc: "Germany itself has become synonymous with our name. We are the rulers of the Germans - no one else. By blood and iron, we have rendered countless petty states our own. We must finish the job!"
 teu_into_bohemia_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Into Bohemia[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_into_bohemia_desc: "Bohemia ruling itself never does so satisfactorily. Heresies spring up, rebellions raze its interior and all too often, foreigners lay claim to its vulnerable throne. Bohemia will never prosper as it should until it becomes a part of our realm!"
 teu_crush_the_south_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Crush the South[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_crush_the_south_desc: "The Germans of the south remain in a sorry state. The only unity they've known has been temporary, or worse, under that of barbaric incursions. It is only natural that it is the next step in our expansion." 
 teu_end_of_era_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]The End of an Era[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_end_of_era_desc: "All things must come to an end - even the likes of the Empire. For too long it has hindered the ambitions of many a conqueror. We, who are the rightful rulers of Germany, can tolerate it no longer - it must be relegated to the pages of history for us to reign proper."
 teu_eastern_campaign_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Eastern Campaign[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_eastern_campaign_desc: "To the east, an entire different world of Christendom awaits. A flavour of heresy, so alien and removed from our own, colours these lands. It is only right that we correct this aberrance and bring the true word to the Slavic world."
 teu_eliminate_the_hordes_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Eliminate the Hordes[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_eliminate_the_hordes_desc: "Our newfound Slavic subjects have regaled us with many a tale of Mongol incursions. For decades, they have suffered under the 'Tatar Yoke' - the cruel, humiliating domination of heathen armies riding on wicked horseback. By God's will, we will banish this terror from the steppe!"
 teu_conquest_of_china_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Conquest of China[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_conquest_of_china_desc: "Since ancient times, tales have run abound of a land to the far east of great prosperity, rich culture and exquisite goods. Now, with our empire stretching from west to east, we find ourselves upon its doorstep. To our horror, we've discovered that they aren't following Christ! How unfortunate - they require correction."
 teu_adapt_to_the_plains_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Adapt to the Plains[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_adapt_to_the_plains_desc: "The plains upon which we now tread are not only treacherous - they are big, too. So big, they take a long time to traverse. The locals, as well as the ruinous Mongols, have mastered the trek of the steppe by means of horseback. We have some learning to do! Perhaps we'll even beat them at their own game."
 teu_order_of_the_steppes_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Order of the Steppes[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_order_of_the_steppes_desc: "With our newfound wisdom of the steppe, it is only right that we master the steppe outright! We must hone our new riders until they are twice the monstrosity that the Mongols were. Armies must tremble, crumble and surrender before the power of our steeds!"
 teu_global_crusade_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Global Crusade[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_global_crusade_desc: "Our destiny has never been more clear to us now. God has willed it that we not only subsume the Baltic, Eastern Europe, but also, the world's entirety - bringing his will to each and every heart that lives under his sun. Our crusade was never merely Baltic - it was always a global one. Deus Vult, to the ends of the Earth!" 
 teu_liberate_carpathia_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Liberate Carpathia[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_liberate_carpathia_desc: "Carpathia has suffered for too long! Its vulnerable plains have been infested with steppe peoples from afar. We must root out the rot and bring the region under God!"
 teu_end_the_schism_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]End the Schism[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_end_the_schism_desc: "Long ago, the churches of east and west fractured and split. Constantinople turned its back on Europe proper - as a result, great misfortune has befallen them. With our newfound strength and God's ordinance, we can correct this grave error once and for all!"
 teu_recover_holy_land_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU]Recover the Holy Land[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_TEU_end]"
 teu_recover_holy_land_desc: "Jerusalem! At last, the Holy Land is within our grasp. Within our lifetimes, the Holy Land may soon be liberated and returned to the arms of Christ once and for all!"

# Events #
 ab_papal.1.t: "The Imperial Protection"
 ab_papal.1.d: "Over the past few years of Saracen encroachment on the Holy See, many closest advisors of His Holiness have come to him with a clever but controversial solution. The Papal States have long prized their independence from the Frankish Emperors since the Empire began to decentralize. However, times have changed and pledging nominal loyalty to the Holy Roman Emperor would certainly be a fate better than Rome falling to the ever-growing power of the heathens to the south. Desperate times call for desperate measures, but ultimately the choice will be left in the hands of His Holiness himself."
 ab_papal.1.a: "It seems we have no other choice..."
 ab_papal.1.b: "Unthinkable!"
 ab_papal.2.t: "The Holy See Requests to Join the Empire"
 ab_papal.2.d: "This morning, a courier brought news of a very unexpected letter from His Holiness in Rome. Instead of the usual requests to fill the Vatican's coffers, His Holiness has requested that he be allowed to join the Holy Roman Empire. At last, the dream of Charlemagne can be restored again - Rome once more under Roman rule, at least nominally. However, as good as this would be for us, it would severely undermine Papal authority - something that  could have serious long term ramifications for the entire Catholic world."
 ab_papal.2.a: "If Rome is threatened, we will be its sword and shield!"
 ab_papal.2.b: "Alas, their fate is up to God now"
 ab_papal.3.t: "The Emperor Accepts"
 ab_papal.3.d: "The Imperial envoy arrived this morning with a message from the Holy Roman Empire. The Emperor has allowed us in the Empire. We may be safe now, but at what cost?"
 ab_papal.3.a: "Surely our authority is still unquestionable..."
 ab_papal.4.t: "The Emperor Declines"
 ab_papal.4.d: "The Imperial envoy has returned - the Emperor has refused to give us aid in these dark times. Whatever our fate will be, it will be in our hands alone."
 ab_papal.4.a: "Deus adiuva nos omnes!"
 ab_papal.5.t: "The Fate of Constantinople"
 ab_papal.5.d: "The City of the World's Desire is now fully under the control of our armies. We have successfully managed to avenge the failure of the Fourth Crusade and must now decide what to do with the ravaged city. Though some wish that the city remains under the control of the Holy See, others have suggested to create a new state; the Latin Empire centered in Constantinople which would be a sign of our triumph over the Orthodox world. This might be the first step in mending the Schism, one way or another."
 ab_papal.5.a: "We will keep the city"
 ab_papal.5.b: "The Latin Empire will be established in Constantinople"
 ab_papal.5.c: "The Latin Empire will be established in Thrace"
 ab_papal.5.e: "The Latin Empire will be established in all of Greece"
 ab_papal.6.t: "The Swiss Guard"
 ab_papal.6.d: "The ink has dried on the contract establishing the Pontifical Swiss Guard. This elite regiment is made up of disciplined and experienced men with an absolute loyalty to the Holy Father. They have sworn to serve the Papal State until Judgement Day."
 ab_papal.6.a: "They will defend the Church well"
 ab_papal.7.t: "The Return of Tiepolo"
 ab_papal.7.d: "During his service, Giordano Tiepolo was the most venerated and skilled general to guide the Papal armies in decades, if not centuries. When the crusade against Andalusia was called, Tiepolo became the leader of the Papal force sent to fight alongside the Holy Roman Empire. His mastery on the battlefield secured the Christian coalition several minor victories in the very beginning of the campaign, but nobody was prepared for the fate that was about to befall the crusaders at Valencia. Barely surviving the bloodbath, Tiepolo returned to Rome and retired his office, partially blaming himself for the devastating defeat. Now that the Eternal City itself is under a threat of a Muslim invasion, the Holy See recalled him back, giving him a chance to redeem his name and reputation on the battlefield."
 ab_papal.7.a: "May he lead us to victory!"
 ab_papal.8.t: "Restoration of the Papacy"
 ab_papal.8.d: "As the fires are smothered and rebuilding begins in the Holy City the people and Europe as a whole rejoice. After a hard fought battle and by the grace of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and his Holy Father, Rome is once more in Christian hands. While Christian forces comb through the city enacting cull the heathen barbarians that still taint the Holy City, the true extent of the damage they caused is revealed to us. Great works of art and architecture were destroyed or looted back to the enemy homelands. St Peter's Basilica, once a shining beacon of Christian architecture, has been defiled by minarets and supplications to their so-called prophet. Work has already begun to reverse these new additions and restore the Basilica back to what it once was.\n\nAs the Pope readies himself to return however, advisors and cardinals speak in hushed whispers of a new fire burning in his heart. The elder statesman and head of the Catholic Church has been overcome with a religious zeal not seen since the Crusades. He feels he is personally responsible for the deplorable state Rome now finds itself in. He has sworn, to himself, his Cardinals, Catholic faithful across the world and God himself, that the accursed Sacrean will no longer defile such a holy place. The righteous armies of God will drive these dirty heathens back to the caves from which they came from and burn them from house and home. Their holy cities of Mecca and Medina will know the suffering of Rome ten fold and then some! And as Christian Armies throw their treasured relics into the sea, they shall know the debt is paid."
 ab_papal.8.a: "Furor dei percutiat gentes ab hac terra!" 
 ab_papal.9.t: "The Kingdom of God on Earth"
 ab_papal.9.d: "Having united the whole of Italy under the banner of Catholicism, the Pope has seen fit to declare it 'The Kingdom of God'. Catholics from all over Europe flock to his banner, eager to live in this model nation of Christian virtue. Foreign powers can no longer control the College of Cardinals, but neither will they pay much heed to any Papal bulls or decrees."
 ab_papal.9.a: "All Men under one God!"
 ab_papal.10.t: "Conversion of China"
 ab_papal.10.d: "Word has reached Rome of startling developments in the Far East. Eiather due to the will of their sovereign or the armies of Christ, the people of China have begun to accept the word of God. From Peking to the Pearl River, from Shanghai to slopes of the Tibetan Plateau the Church has been growing its flock by the thousands. However, it is not strictly the Church in Rome that these new converts follow. The ancient heresy Manichaeism has survived and even thrived in the Far East for centuries. As the Chinese turn to the light of the lord, many of them have turned to the gospel of Mani, rather than the will of the Pope. This poses a threat to the immortal souls of millions of men, women and children. To combat this growing heresy the Pope has dispatched a team of skilled cardinals and priests to not only organize the new Far Eastern diocese, but begin to push back the Manichaens. There are no illusions in Rome that this will be a spiritual battle this Church has not seen since the conversion of Rome, but it is vital that the true word of the Lord be victorious.\n\nHowever, back in Europe the news of the conversion of the Far East has lit a fire in the hearts of all true Christians. With millions of new converts flocking to the Church now more than ever are the hearts of all sons and daughters of Christ put to rest. This is most pronounced in the priests, who now preach to their flock with righteous fire. Some have suggested we harness this new fervor into the conversion efforts."
 ab_papal.10.a: "A day of celebration for all of Christian Europe!"
 ab_papal.10.b: "One more realm brought within the word of Christ"
 ab_papal.11.t: "Conversion of Japan"
 ab_papal.11.d: "Incredible news has reached Europe from Japan. Eiather through the commands of their daimyo or the might of Christian arms, the Japanese people have begun to embrace Christianity en masse. While at first harshly oppressed by the Shoguns, both Mongol and Japanese, the so called ‘hidden Christians’ or Kakure Kirishitan, have finally emerged into the light of a land championing their faith. However, while great leaps and bounds have been made, there is still much work to be done. Chief amongst the tasks set before the Church is cracking down on the syncretic blend of folk beliefs seeping into Japanese Christianity. Many Japanese have accepted the Lord not as the one and only God, but another God amongst many in their Shinto pantheon. Meanwhile, in a village named Shindo, some have claimed that Jesus had escaped crucifixion, fled to Japan and lived his life in the villiage, even dressing up a local grave as his own. If the Catholic canon is to establish itself in far off Nippon then these beliefs must be swiftly corrected, lest they become the foundation of a heretical splinter in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Europe the people rejoice at the news. This is rightfully seen as yet another confirmation of the righteousness of the Word of God. If even the most barbaric of lands so far from civilization can see enough reason to accept it, then it may only be a matter of time before all peoples see the same reason. This growing revelation has inspired a new wave of priests to join the Papal flock. However, not content at preaching at friends and family long converted, they ask to be sent out to spread the borders of Christiandom to Eastern Europe and beyond."
 ab_papal.11.a: "God is good and gracious in all things"
 ab_papal.11.b: "May even the most baseborn Eastern barbarian learn the Good Word!"
 ab_papal.12.t: "[From.GetName] Converts to Christianity"
 ab_papal.12.d: "Today we have received a report from our recent effort to convert the nearby pagans. The group we dispatched to spearhead the effort have reported incredible success with many of the heathens readily taking to the Good Book. They stress that while the upper caste of the barbarians society has largely accepted the Word of God, much work remains to be done in converting the general population. They predict no less than a decade of concerted effort will be required, but do say that with the leaders helping them, things will go much faster than otherwise."
 ab_papal.12.a: "Laus Deo, Domino et Salvatori nostro!"
 ab_papal.13.t: "[From.GetName] Rejects Conversion"
 ab_papal.13.d: "Today we have received a messenger from the lands we sent our priests too. He comes bearing the heads of them all and a simple message to stay out. Such a grisly demonstration means that our recent efforts to bring the heathens into the light of God have gone…poorly. We have no contact from those who may have been converted before our righteous martyrs met their end, so its safe to say that our latest effort has failed utterly. The demonstration of such failure was so grisly, that it will take some time before we can convince more priests to go and try again."
 ab_papal.13.a: "Animas eorum salvet, si non in hac vita, sequenti."
 ab_papal.14.t: "Fate of Islam"
 ab_papal.14.d: "The Armies of Muhammed are routed. Our armies camp in the Sacred Mosque in Mecca and patrol the grounds of the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. The Islamic world is up in arms over our occupation. Every day we receive messages from Muslim rulers across the world renouncing us in every language in God's Kingdom. They preach of fire and brimstone, of a great tide of bodies coming to annihilate us, of Jihad. We will not be cowed. Those hypocrites in Baghdad and Cordoba and Sicily celebrated as they defiled our own holy cities. They tore down holy places and defaced them with their own barbaric images. Now that they suffer the same as we had, they cry foul. Let them come and let the armies of God crush them as we have done before.\n\nIn the cities a debate has begun about what happens next. The loudest voices, those who suffered under Muslim yoke, demand fire and blood. They cry for vengeance for Rome, now decades in the making. They demand Mecca and Medina be razed to the ground and the Earth salted beneath the ruins. They want to watch as their precious Black Stone is thrown into the Sea, the Kaaba is torn down and turned into a latrine and the body of the Prophet is scattered to the dogs. They, however, are in the minority. A larger group of cardinals have asked that leniency be shown to the Holy Cities. They point out that destroying two entire cities that are the holiest in Islam would only inspire ceaseless furor in our new Muslim subjects. The constant revolts would make any sort of governance of the area impossible and possibly permanently inspire the Muslims to violence against their Christian brothers. They say that only through herculean acts of kindness could we bring God to the Islamic heathens."
 ab_papal.14.a: "The desolation of Rome shall be repaid tenfold!"
 ab_papal.14.b: "Let Christian charity lead us into a more peaceful future"
 ab_papal.15.t: "A Successful Crusade"
 ab_papal.15.d: "Today the sun shines a bit brighter over the Earth, for the armies of Christ are victorious! When the Pope called for this Crusade many laughed and much of Europe ignored him. However, as heathen armies scatter before us, broken and defeated, the laughing has quieted. Now they celebrate just as much as those who stood by our brave warriors. Today is a glorious day, let all celebrate it!"
 ab_papal.15.a: "Deus Vult!"
 ab_papal.16.t: "Crusade On [europa_crusade_target.GetName]"
 ab_papal.16.d: "Today, to a thronging crowd of thousands of pious Christians, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has declared a new Crusade! The forces of hereticism and barbarity are on the march and they threaten the heart of Civilization in Europe. Led by the f orces of [europa_crusade_target.GetName] they pillage and plunder their way forwards. Unless something is done to stop it, then all of Christiendom is at risk of extinction! However, while our soldiers are buoyed by the favor of Christ and the Lord, some suggest that the enemies of Christ are too numerous to be fought alone. They urge His Holiness to call all Christan nations forwards, in the spirit of 1096, to drive back the forces of darkness and bring countless thousands back into the light of the Lord!"
 ab_papal.16.a: "Let all Christian faithful absolve themselves with the sword of the Lord!"
 ab_papal.16.b: "Let the us see these blasphemers and heathens to their graves!"
 ab_papal.17.t: "The Liberation of Rome"
 ab_papal.17.d: "The capital of the Roman Empire, holy city among holy cities, the Eternal City had been desecrated by Muslim heretics. Plundered, brutalised, martyred, Rome seemed to have been lost forever as the crescent floated over St. Peter’s Basilica. But soon Christendom dried its tears and guided by the divine light of Christ, it prepared its liberating armies. On that day, by the glory of the Lord, Father of Men and God of the Universe, Rome was liberated. Christians can celebrate, for today peace has been restored and those who dared to attack the Father’s children have been punished, for such is His will!"
 ab_papal.17.a: "Deus Vult!"

 pap_end_berber_raids_desc: "The Corsairs from Barbaria have gained immense notoriety in Italy, their razziah-surprise attacks—growing ever more frequent and devastating. These slave raids leave nothing but ruin in their wake. The time has come to cut the serpent’s head and ensure their tyranny of the seas ends forever. Their galleys will rest at the bottom of the Mediterranean, their fortresses reduced to ash, and their raiders' corpses will serve as grim reminders that no heathen may challenge the might of Christendom unpunished." 
 pap_rally_christendom_title: "Rally Christendom" 
 pap_rally_christendom_desc: "While the Nizzarid and Andalusian Sultans tighten their grip over the Middle East and Europe respectively, Christian kings remain mired in wars, spilling the blood of their own brethren. If we are to stand a chance against these encroaching heathens, we must rally all of Christendom under the singular Banner of God. By uniting our fractured realms and pooling our men and resources, we can forge an unshakable alliance and reclaim the glory of our faith in the face of adversity." 
 pap_mare_nostrum_title: "Mare Nostrum" 
 pap_mare_nostrum_desc: "While our shipbuilding skills are nearly unrivaled across the Mediterranean, several nations still command a larger fleet than our own. The great Sea has become a dominion of the Muslims, whose piracy and disruption of our trade routes threaten the very lifeblood of the Christian world. If we are to restore peace and security to our waters, we must build a navy to rival any other power, and show the heathens that the Mediterranean shall forever remain the Mare Nostrum of the faithful." 
 pap_global_crusade_title: "Global Crusade"
 pap_global_crusade_desc: "The Catholic Church’s position in Europe has been completely secured. There is no state remaining on the continent which can defy the supreme authority of the Pope. Yet, our mission is not yet complete. Across the world, powerful nations continue to reject the mercy and grace of our Lord. We must embark on a global crusade to bring salvation to their souls, delivering divine justice and guiding them onto the path of righteousness."
 pap_sweep_the_po_title: "Sweep the Po" 
 pap_sweep_the_po_desc: "With Romagna under our fold, the natural conclusion would be to continue along the Po River into the great Po Valley. Being home to both fertile plains in la Bassa and defensible hills in the north, control over the valley will allow us to expand our economic base and prevent further heretic expansion into North Italy." 
 pap_found_the_jesuits_title: "Found the Jesuits" 
 pap_found_the_jesuits_desc: "Following the Papal Bull 'Regimini militantis ecclesiae', the Jesuits shall be formalized as a Holy Order. Their mission is simple: To obey the commands of the Holy Father as if they were lifeless bodies. Bound by vows of chastity and obedience, they shall preach the words of the Gospel to the farthest corners of the world and aid us in combatting the newfound heresies in Europe, either by the school or the sword." 
 pap_mission_japan_title: "Mission to Japan" 
 pap_mission_japan_desc: "The Island of Japan boasts some of the greatest wonders known to man. Towering Castles, beautiful landscape and brave warriors. However, the brutal civil war which engulfed the Island has left a war-weary population and power-hungry warlords. Perhaps they would be eager to embrace our Lord if we promise to uplift the conditions of the peasants and a few muskets to the Shoguns." 
 pap_indies_title: "Settlement in the Indies"
 pap_indies_desc: "The East Indies were discovered by our great navigators after years of journey through the treacherous water of the Pacific Ocean. This discovery has brought immense wealth through control of the Spice Trade, but our mission extends far beyond commerce. Settling the uninhabited portions of the Island while converting the Hindus and Muslims native to the land will allow us to continue our Global Crusade without compromising on profit." 
 pap_curia_funding_title: "Restore Curia Funding" 
 pap_curia_funding_desc: "The Camera Apostolica, or the Curia Treasury, is our main source for investigating heresies across Europe and helping the Crusader states in the Levant. If we wish to expand operations across Europe and the World, restoring the Curia's coffers is absolutely pivotal. Achieving this will be no easy task, but with a few golden words and well-placed ‘favours,’ we can ensure the continued flow of wealth to fund our divine mission." 
 pap_colosseum_title: "Rebuild the Colosseum"
 pap_colosseum_desc: "The Colosseum is one of Rome's greatest architectural achievements, standing proudly in the heart of the Eternal City. The tales of great battles and grand spectacles held in its amphitheater have been passed down through the ages. While no Pope since John XII would dream of restoring gladiator battles in the arena, rebuilding the Colosseum could inspire our soldiers with its timeless grandeur and serve as a symbol of Rome’s unyielding spirit."
 pap_new_world_title: "Discovery of the New World"
 pap_new_world_desc: "The great explorers of Europe, in their search for the Indian subcontinent, have stumbled across an entirely new continent. While other nations greedily eye the 'mountains of gold' of the New World, our motive is far more pious. The vile faith of the Indians has regressed their society to the point where mindless slaughter is seen as a virtue. As the bearers of the Holy Cross, it shall be our duty to guide these lost souls to salvation and save them from eternal damnation."
 pap_mission_china_title: "Mission to China"
 pap_mission_china_desc: "The land of Cathay is not only home to immense riches, but also to a large heathen population. While these sheep deserve the affection of the Lord, mass conversions might attract vengeful retaliation from the sovereign of the Dragon Throne. To avoid such useless bloodshed, let us establish a more peaceful Jesuit Mission in China, planting the seeds of faith that may one day flourish and illuminate the land with the light of Christ."
 pap_install_antipope_title: "Install the Antipope" 
 pap_install_antipope_desc: "The College of Cardinals have made a grave mistake by elevating a craven and inept bastard to the position of Pope. His reign has seen Roma change from a holy and pious city to one where corruption and vice runs rampant. It is clear that such a coward cannot be expected to rule over virtuous Catholics. We must stand in opposition to the Conclave and elect our very own Anti-Pope so that Christendom can be saved." 
 pap_rally_our_forces_title: "Rally Our Forces"
 pap_rally_our_forces_desc: "The Papal Army finds itself weak and disorganized after their recent skirmishes with other fiefs. To press the legitimate claim of the Antipope to the Holy See, we must raise our levies, rally our commanders and strike Rome to depose the Pope while their military capabilities have been exhausted."
 pap_a_new_pope_title: "A New Pope"
 pap_a_new_pope_desc: " With the Papal Army routed and our men firmly entrenched around Rome, victory is all but assured. It is now time to prepare for the ascension of [monarch.getname] as the new Pope. Under his watchful and righteous eye, we shall cleanse the vices plaguing Rome and restore the faith of sceptics in the Catholic Church, ushering in a new era of spiritual renewal."
 pap_professional_mercs_title: "Professional Mercenaries" 
 pap_professional_mercs_desc: "While observing modern militaries, the term 'professional mercenaries' may seem like an oxymoron. Mercenaries are often seen as the pinnacle of indiscipline-as an organised gang of looters and thugs rather than a true fighting force. However, with the promise of higher pay and the guarantee of salvation under our banner, we may convince these unruly bands to abandon their hooliganism and adopt a disciplined, professional approach to warfare."
 pap_support_crusaders_title: "Support the Crusaders" 
 pap_support_crusaders_desc: "The Crusader Kingdoms remain the final bastion of Christianity in the Levant. Unfortunately, due to decades of internal strife, they have been weakened considerably. As the threat of Islamic invasion grows day by day, the duty to assume the mantle of the defender of Crusaders falls upon us. Under the watchful eye of the Holy Father, we shall lead these soldiers of God to victory."
 pap_kingdom_of_outremer_title: "Kingdom of Outremer" 
 pap_kingdom_of_outremer_desc: "We have managed to successfully defend the Crusader states from the armies of the Nizzarid Sultan. For too long have we been on the defensive, now it is time to take the war to their cities. Our march into Egypt and Syria shall be paralleled by no force, and we shall only rest when all of the Levant chants the name of our Lord. Deus Vult!" 
 pap_fate_of_islam_title: "Fate of Islam"
 pap_fate_of_islam_desc: "Just a few decades ago, the loss of the Holy Cities to the Islamic scourge seemed inevitable. Yet, our unwavering faith in God, strong enough to move mountains, inspired our armies to halt their advance and force them onto the defensive. As the Caliph's army beats the drum of retreat, let us remind them that their rejection of our Lord's mercy will not go unpunished. On the mountains of Mecca, we shall sing the Song of God, praise His name and proclaim His salvation day by day, for the heathen who defied His glory shall be slain."

 ab_venice.1.t: "The Golden Republic"
 ab_venice.1.d: "Few have ever attained our level of wealth, opulence and power throughout the history of this domain. Once confined to the Adriatic and meagre eastern holdings in Greek lands, we grew our Serene Republic out into the greater Mediterranean Sea. Larger and larger the Republic grew, until a kingdom it could not be called. Many will always deny it, but the only aspiring legacy the rulers of Europe will ever acknowledge as greater than their own will always be the Romans. In our pursuit of greater wealth, the whispering winds of the Mediterranean revived the Roman spirit, driving an unassailable headwind in which our people had taken ahold of with both hands. Where the Romans enforced their will through sheer military might, the Venetian people will bend the avarice of humans to our bidding, spreading our ideals across the seas and their wealth through our veins. Though we still have far left to go, the Most Serene Republic of Italy has become the golden heart of Europe; a Golden Republic."

# Missions #
 ven_inculti_desc: "The department for uncultivated natural resources was set up to assist in the draining of marshland and the irrigation of drylands. With Venetian territories scattered across the Mediterranean and easily blockaded by hostile forces, any pragmatic leader would see to it that all territories can remain largely self-sufficient. By ensuring this, Venice proper can be supplied food by our landbound traders and ensure we can exploit all natural resources possible."
 ven_secure_aegean_title: "Secure Aegean Trade"
 ven_secure_aegean_desc: "Without the leadership of a united Seljuk administration, Anatolia collapsed into a myriad of cultures, faiths and most importantly, interests. As they all stand divided from one another, our mercenary armies are free to play the local rivalries off each other like puppets on a string, while they ensure our coffers are overflowing. Our existing Aegean holdings are an excellent springboard for securing Aegean trade for ourselves."
 ven_indian_hegemony_title: "Indian Hegemony"
 ven_indian_hegemony_desc: "Without a doubt, direct investment from the Doge's Palace in sailing past the Suez and through the endless sand hills confining the Red Sea has finally paid off. The sands of Arabia have hidden immense wealth and opportunities lying dormant in the Indian subcontinent. The mastery of gentle, flowing textiles, the myriad colours of spices and the sheer number of people make it feel like a whole new world! Enjoying hegemony over Indian trade may provide us with wealth overflowing from our coffers, if that is even possible..."
 ven_integrate_verona_title: "Integrate Verona"
 ven_integrate_verona_desc: "Verona lies on the river Adige, the sole waterway that flows south of our heartland. As such, the Veronese republic controls all the key water crossings that isolate us from the rest of Italy. If we are to have any aspirations for a unification of the Italian peninsula, it must first start with integrating the Veronese lands into our crown lands. We cannot tolerate any threat of a home at war!"
 ven_republic_italy_title: "Republic of Italy"
 ven_republic_italy_desc: "Venice has always been the best of the Italians. Our aspirations were always outside of the Peninsula, aiming to gain holdings across the entire known world in pursuit of greater wealth. It was only with the stranglehold of outgoing Mediterranean trade between the Muslim rival caliphates that flipped our focus into more local affairs. First, it was uniting the Venetian people by integrating Verona, then it was crushing the Iron Crown and subjugating the Romagnan statelets. A stagnant Saracen south was ripe for the taking, and most of Italy was already united under our control. The final holdouts in western Italy under the fierce protection of the Holy Roman Empire were no match for our amassed wealth and arms. The wealth and opulence of Italy shall be displayed for the world to see, and for all to look on in envy!"
 ven_suez_canal_title: "Build the Canal"
 ven_suez_canal_desc: "One of the first Venetian dreams was to be able to build a canal across the Suez desert, bypassing the need to pay the exorbitant tax the Umayyad caliphate levies upon Christian fleets. Building this canal will unlock a world of dreams beyond the Zagreb, with incredibly rare goods free for the... trading."
 ven_end_saracen_title: "End the Saracens"
 ven_end_saracen_desc: "Ever since the failure of the Norman coalition against the Shia Sultanate of Sicily and their rapid expansion in southern Italy, it has been the singular cause of the Italian Christians that have seemed to unite them. A convenient lightningrod for military attention, the Saracens have finally outlasted their use. With our endless fleets supplied by the Venetian Arsenal and our plethora of mercernaries ready to march at once, it is once again time to remove a Muslim threat from European shores!"
 ven_black_sea_title: "Black Sea Monopoly"
 ven_black_sea_desc: "The Black Sea has always been an unreachable dream for Venetian trade. It was an inevitability, of course, what with our hidden blade striking the Byzantine Empire as a pivot from the Fourth Crusade. Our opportunistic deceit earned us their eternal hostility, and we have never been able to sail past the Strait of Marmara as a result. With the collapse of the Byzantines to the Bulgars, relations have somewhat normalised, and we are now free to seek new opportunities, and perhaps establish a monopoly over Black Sea trade..."

This has thus spared us from the debilitated state most of the continent shares, giving us a single, invaluable opportunity to extinguish Lotharingian ambitions to reconquer the Low Countries!"
 ned_rival_hansa_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Rival Hansa[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_rival_hansa_desc: "The only thing that man will seek more than land, is wealth. This could not be more true for the Hanseatic League, where the only thing that links its members together are the coins none will relinquish their hold on. We should decide if we should join in their kleptocracy, or ruin it!"
 ned_control_the_sound_toll_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]End the Sound Toll[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_control_the_sound_toll_desc: "The trade between the North Sea and the Baltics is ever lucrative, with many intersecting interests between faith, territorial conflict and just a need for resources. None can deny the desire to control the Sound Toll as an excellent naval base to control the Baltic Sea. The disintegration of the Great Heathen Army upon the British Isles and their maritime support presents a prime opportunity for us to strike the Danish holdings. Let us end the Sound Toll to fund further ambitions in Northern Europe and the Baltics."
 ned_germanic_settlements_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Germanic Settlements[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_germanic_settlements_desc: "Although we have taken control over the Sound Toll and ensured our place in Baltic trade, our control over the region is still tenuous at best. Without control over the Danevirkes, assaults can easily be launched through the Ox Road. We must ensure we have sufficiently local supply points for both our fleets and soldiers to maintain authority in the Baltics."
 ned_secure_baltic_grain_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Secure Baltic Grain[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_secure_baltic_grain_desc: "Though the Dutch lands are prosperous and bring us great wealth, the downside is our severe lack of farming space. With our Lowlands right by the sea, it is unsuitable for long-term grazing by cattle. Lands in the Baltic like Old Prussia and the Jutlands are prime grazing lands, with their open grasslands and temperate climate. Securing the Baltic grain will ensure our people will be fed for centuries."
 ned_raise_the_trading_towns_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Raise the Trading Towns[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_raise_the_trading_towns_desc: "The most lucrative trading routes in the Baltics were once part of the so-called 'Amber Road'. Stretching from Old Prussia to Venice, these roads transported amber and other precious gems, but now fall into disrepair. If we were to fund the revival of the amber trade, the local industries would be exuberant!"
 ned_baltic_colonies_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Baltic Colonies[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_baltic_colonies_desc: "The German Catholic colonies in the Baltic were the hallmarks of an ambition long gone, the last vestiges of Christian order strongholds. Where they failed, we were unerringly successful, and developing these fertile lands by migrating our own experts will ensure our culture will truly take root here."
 ned_seize_jutland_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Seize Jutland[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_seize_jutland_desc: "The crude Danes have been raiding the coastlines of Christian coastal settlements for far too long. With the collapse of their offensive on the British Isles, they have returned home to lick their wounds. Perhaps, it is time for them to have a taste of their own medicine and see what it feels like."
 ned_kiel_canal_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]The Kiel Canal[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_kiel_canal_desc: "With control of the Sound Toll having long been out of foreign hands and in our control, there have been many who have sought a shorter way to cross the Channel and into the Baltic - much like those seeking another way to Asia. We could leverage the demand for new trade routes into ensuring our merchants wield a great advantage."
 ned_baltic_crusade_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Purge the Pagans[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_baltic_crusade_desc: "The threat of the pagans have loomed over the Holy Roman Empire for centuries now. The North German margraves, between the Harrying of the North and the Burgerkriege, have lost all remaining energy and motivation to combat the Wends. Our patient buildup should be best used now to lead a crusade into the Baltics and unite the Baltic coastlines."
 ned_rival_the_royal_navy_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Rival the Royal Navy[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_rival_the_royal_navy_desc: "If there is one thing that the Ænglish did right, it was invest in their Royal Navy, a 'wooden wall' that thwarted mainland European invasions off from the British Isles. If we are to enforce our ambitions on the dissenting heptarchy in Ængland, we will first need to establish our own shining navy to rival theirs. Let us blast their ships and line their coast with their own so-called 'wooden wall'!"
 ned_second_hastings_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Second Haestingas[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_second_hastings_desc: "When the cowardly Normans lost the war at Haestings without a single battle, trampling on their own monarch in their embarrassing retreat, it paved the way for Ænglish decadence for centuries to come. Without another threat from the mainland, the nobles devolved into petty power grabs, ensuring Ænglish lands would not prosper for a long time. Their standing army weak and corrupt, it is ripe for the crushing; we will show them a REAL Battle of Haestings."
 ned_dissolve_the_heptarchy_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Dissolve the Heptarchy[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_dissolve_the_heptarchy_desc: "Time and again has shown that the Ænglish Heptarchy cannot be trusted to hold egos, let alone their own swords to battle. Where our brave men hold their shining, silver blades with calloused hands, those of the Ænglish prefer to line their hands with gold instead. It is unquestionably our priority to dissolve this inept Heptarchy!"
 ned_british_domination_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]British Domination[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_british_domination_desc: "We have shown clearly that the even Dutch peasants are better at taming the lands than all Ænglish kings. With the British Isles assimilated into our realm, it comes to us to educate their serfs in the way of the Dutch, and ensure they become our people in heart and mind."
 ned_adopt_english_traditions_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Adopt Ænglish Traditions[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_adopt_english_traditions_desc: "For all that the Ænglish failed at, they managed to survive the disasters of the last century better than most. With their people pacified and integrated within our realm, we can burn away the flubber and take the useful parts of their local traditions."
 ned_united_kingdoms_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]The United Kingdoms[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_united_kingdoms_desc: "As much as one could denigrate the ineptitude of English leadership, the English people are our wayward siblings, led astray by a cruel shepherd. Through long-suffering placation and patient investment, the British Isles have come to welcome us with open arms and unwavering life. The Dutch Kingdoms and English heptarchy have been united as one, and together, we are a United Kingdom."
 ned_brittonic_strongholds_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Brittonic Strongholds[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_brittonic_strongholds_desc: "The last of the Britonnic Celts outside of Ireland itself are now exposed to us with our newly developed navy. Their weak standing and diplomatic isolation would make for an excellent landing point in order to launch our invasion of the Ænglish lands."
 ned_the_emerald_isle_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]The Emerald Isle[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_the_emerald_isle_desc: "Cozy in their insular corner of the world, the Irish lands have never been united as one. Though most are vassal to the High King, the feudal clans only pay lip service as much as the princes do to the Carolingians. With the Ænglish being too inept to bring proper civilisation to the Emerald Isles, it comes to us to take up the job."
 ned_scottish_intervention_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Scottish Intervention[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_scottish_intervention_desc: "Sandwiched between the Great Heathen Army and the ever belligerent Ænglish, the Scottish lands have had narry a chance to let down their guard. Our sweep of the lands south of their border has allowed them to recuperate and focus on matters to their north, and it will only be a matter of time before they turn towards us. The last threat left to our rule of these Isles shall be put under... new administration."
 ned_push_into_germany_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Push into Germany[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_push_into_germany_desc: "Despite our best defenses, our nation is shallow and easily approachable from the east. Our coastal lands are barely a day's march away from any threats. We will reluctantly need to venture into German lands and control a larger portion of the region before we can venture to the horizons."
 ned_solidify_our_domination_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Solidify our Domination[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_solidify_our_domination_desc: "At first, we took control of the German border regions in order to secure our continental holdings. However, it has now become apparent that there is weakness in the Emperor's grip over the Holy Roman Empire. States all over Europe have begun to take advantage of this. We would be foolish not to seize the day and solidify our domination over Northern Europe!"
 ned_gateway_to_the_rhineland_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Gateway to the Rhineland[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_gateway_to_the_rhineland_desc: "The German Rhineland region has recently become one of the most prosperous and wealthy regions in Europe. With the fires of industry in full force, it would make a great addition to our collection..."
 ned_imperial_hegemony_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Imperial Hegemony[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_imperial_hegemony_desc: "As the Holy Roman Empire collapses into chaos once more, there are a number of states that are taking advantage of the situation. Some will overestimate themselves and threaten belligerence towards others. We will need a sufficiently threatening standing force to act as a warning for them."
 ned_the_tulip_throne_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]The Tulip Throne[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_the_tulip_throne_desc: "The electorates of the Holy Roman Empire have deemed us as the best chance for the Imperial lands to survive the oncoming storm of heathens and religious uncertainty. While we never planned to rule through electorship, we will make the best of what this opportunity can provide us."
 ned_win_the_league_war_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Prevail in the League War[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_win_the_league_war_desc: "The heretics in the Holy Roman Empire have run havoc on the normal running of society for far too long. They have demonstrated their destructive and intolerant methods and, in more ways than one, shown they cannot be trusted to run the electorates without their beliefs overrunning their administration. We must prevail in war and remind them who it is that has the power in the Holy Roman Empire!"
 ned_take_weser_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Take Weser[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_take_weser_desc: "The Hanseatic League has maintained hegemony over the North Sea and the Baltics for as long as Christianity has existed in Northern Europe. Their avarice has ensured the locals everywhere are bereft of the necessities to survive harsh times - we will need to put them down like the dogs they are!"
 ned_claim_the_wealth_of_hansa_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Take Hansa's Place[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_claim_the_wealth_of_hansa_desc: "With the fleets of the Hansa lining the blue depths, a power vacuum in the North Sea has emerged. We will need to take over these lands under a new, less materialistic administration."
 ned_rhenish_economic_hub_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Rhenish Economic Hub[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_rhenish_economic_hub_desc: "Where the fires of industrialisation start, money is to be had. The Rhenish economic hubs are the centre of all trade in Germany, with the largest concentration of inland ports allowing unprecedented naval trade capabilities. Providing ample investment in these hubs will ensure all German trade flows to us!"
 ned_empower_the_burghers_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Empower the Burghers[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_empower_the_burghers_desc: "Trade is the lifeblood of our nation. With our textile industry developed to a great extent, travelling merchants will need to be supported in order to be able to make a considerable sum out of our collective efforts."
 ned_bank_of_europe_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]The Bank of Europe[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_bank_of_europe_desc: "The stability of the Dutch Lowlands has attracted wealthy companies to set up their headquarters here, which has resulted in several proto-banks opening up in our capital. If we were to buy out control of this bank, it could potentially become the bank of Europe in its entirety."
 ned_reclaim_the_polders_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Reclaim the Polders[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_reclaim_the_polders_desc: "During the times of hardship when war was difficult to wage, our best thinkers looked to other methods to gain lands for our people. Our low-lying geography gave birth to the idea that we could literally dig up the land and push out our coastline. Decades later, the reclamation of the Dutch polders is almost complete and safe for long-term use."
 ned_unite_the_low_countries_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Unite the Low Countries[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_unite_the_low_countries_desc: "Though we shared in the prosperity of peacetime, the Lowlands have always been a decentralised mess, with competing interests preventing us from truly being in harmony. Now that we have proven we are the strongest state in the Low Countries, the onus is on us to finally unite the region, once and for all."
 ned_proclaim_united_netherlands_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]The United Netherlands[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_proclaim_united_netherlands_desc: "For close to half a millennium, the Low Countries we now hold have been a staunchly autonomous kingdom within the Holy Roman Empire. Without tribute nor fealty to swear, we have developed one of the most complete and magnificent cultural centres in Europe. A united Netherlands is a wealthy and prolific Netherlands, and we can now proclaim sovereignty over the Seven Provinces and unify of our peoples!"

 ned_focus_on_domestic_affairs_desc: "With our first and most holistic outward expansion complete, it is now time to turn inwards and focus on repairing the unfortunate devastation as a result of recent turmoil.

 ned_free_ports_of_netherlands_desc: "In spite of our relentless investment towards developing our towns into sprawling cities, our realm still has much room to grow. The majority of migrants have journeyed to settle our lands through our free ports. Perhaps this is a sign to pivot towards building several dense metropoles and shift our investments towards naval capabilities..."
 ned_dutch_metropolises_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Dutch Metropoles[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_dutch_metropolises_desc: "From the small regions we controlled in the Lowlands, Dutch ingenuity sprouted. The innovative act of land reclamation allowed our towns to sprawl into cities, and for cities to sprawl into metropoles. Now, with full control of the region, we can extend this act to ensure Dutch prosperity for all!"
 ned_workshop_of_the_world_title: "[GetPreviewColorAB_NED]Workshop of the World[GetPreviewColorAB_NED_end]"
 ned_workshop_of_the_world_desc: "The fires of industrialisation in the Netherlands have pushed the nation into unprecedented wealth and popularity. Our high-end goods, especially our textiles, are more sought after than grain across the world. Already we have invested in national industries to their maximum extent, yet our coffers overflow. We must ensure that those who will not suffer us to be the workshop of the world do not get any ideas..."
 NED_brazilwood_title: "Monopoly on Brazilwood"
 NED_brazilwood_desc: "Brazilwood has become all the rage in the home provinces. Carpenters and distributors alike are scrambling to secure sources for themselves. It would be wise to secure a monopoly."
 NED_heart_of_africa_title: "Heart of Africa"
 NED_heart_of_africa_desc: "Africa is a land of size and depth seemingly unfathomable. While extensive voyages have laid bare its coastlines, the interior remains a shadowy pit beyond reach. He who secures the heartlands will be wealthy beyond belief - both in knowledge and in resources."
 NED_grow_the_cape_colony_title: "Grow the Cape Colony"
 NED_grow_the_cape_colony_desc: "It is of great importance that we solidify our grip on the Cape. By encouraging settlement, investing ducats and entrenching Dutch interests, we could perhaps make of the Cape an integral part of the realm and a lucrative middleman between the Atlantic and Asia."
 NED_base_in_china_title: "A Base in China"
 NED_base_in_china_desc: "China has long been a distant land, relegated to what feels like mythology. Wealth of untold heights, goods of exquisite intrigue, shores of plentiful buyers - now, all at our naval fingertips, ripe for the picking. We would be fools not to establish a base in the region."
