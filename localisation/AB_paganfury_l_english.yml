 sca_fourth3: "Stormaktstiden"
 sca_fourth3_desc: "The Era of Scandinavia has begun; our poets write great songs and works about our achievements; our artists draw on canvas of the defeat of the heathen armies and promote the beauty of our homeland. This period of pride and prestige brings with us a sense of honour and duty; we must not rest on our laurels, we must work to maintain this golden age, no matter the cost!"
 swe_first: "The King and the Church"
 swe_first_desc: "Sweden's monarchy relies upon close ties to the Catholic Church to maintain its legitimacy, as well as to curb the influence of the aristocracy and mercantile class. This relationship has proven fruitful in fostering loyalty and compromise between the two arms of state, with the church offering up its vast resources to the king in exchange for royal favour in court politics." 

# Holy Orders #

 sweabsolutism: "Crusader Absolutism"
 sweabsolutism_desc: "The King of Sweden has the final say in matters of state, for he is the leader of our great Northern Crusades. His word is the highest of law that is backed by both the secular authority of the realm and the divine authority of the Church."
 swecouncil: "Council of the Realm"
 swecouncil_desc: "Since the foundation of the Kingdom of Sweden, there has been a somewhat irregular privy council consisting of the most powerful chiefs within the realm. These magnates were to advise the King, though he always had final say. Over time, as Sweden evolved, this council came to consist of appointed courtiers rather than powerful warlords. By making this council a permanent institution, we can assure the most effective administration possible from this special cabinet. The King of Sweden would be free to appoint whoever he wishes to this council, as long as they are of Swedish birth."
 sweholyfury: "Holy Fury"
 sweholyfury_desc: "The Kingdom of Sweden has worked tirelessly to cultivate a religious fervor in its soldiers. These great Northern Crusaders will follow our leaders with holy fury, furthering our expansion and sacred mission to Christianize Scandinavia."

 ab_sweden.2.a: "Unfortunate"
 ab_sweden.7.t: "The Lion and the Empire"
 ab_sweden.7.d: "The Kingdom of Sweden is the bulwark of Christendom in Scandinavia, and was able to weather the surging tides of Norse heathenry on its own for centuries. Having at long last vanquished the lingering holdouts of paganism in northern Europe, the Great Northern Crusade is finally over; a decisive victory for the Cross. Triumphant at long last, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] seeks to entrench Sweden's position in the region by uniting with the Holy Roman Empire, effectively eliminating military threats to the war weary kingdom. To that end, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] has directly petitioned [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] to grant Sweden entry into the Holy Roman Empire. Although the Holy Roman Empire would benefit from this arrangement, Sweden stands to gain far more, leading many to doubt whether it would be a worthwhile endeavour in the long term..."

Has directly petitioned our liege, [Emperor.GetName], to grant Sweden entry into the Holy Roman Empire. Although we would likely benefit from this arrangement, gaining a staunch bulwark against the Rus and Saxons, Sweden stands to gain far more than us. Many within the court, as well as the princely magnates of the Empire, doubt whether it would be a worthwhile endeavour in the long term. After all, should a realm as overwhelming as Sweden become an Imperial princedom, they would be in a prime position to challenge [Emperor.GetName]'s hold on the throne..."

 ab_swe_scanian_uprising_title: "The Scanian Uprising"
 ab_swe_scanian_uprising_desc: "The good men of Scania, christians loyal and true, find themselves oppressed by their foul Viking overlords. Their devotion to God has earned them scorn and oppression. Only time will tell how this conflict will proceed."
 ab_swe_call_crusade_title: "Call of the Crusade"
 ab_swe_call_crusade_desc: "Sweden stands converted, taught of the glory of God. His light surely radiates across Scandinavia, but even still, evil permeates this land. Ignorance drowns out all His wisdom. Violence is the only language spoken in this ancient region - so let us remember how to speak it ourselves and reignite the crusade!"
 ab_swe_catholic_alliances_title: "Catholic Alliances"
 ab_swe_catholic_alliances_desc: "Enemies surround us on all sides. We are an island of purity in a sea of pagan filth. We must not become isolated and lonesome, lest these godless hordes get the better of us!"
 ab_swe_scania_title: "Scanian Intervention"
 ab_swe_scania_desc: "Our army is bursting with potential. Allies stand ready behind us. Faithful across Sweden pray diligently to the good Lord, knowing he will aid us in the conflict to come. We will reclaim our Faithful! Deus Vult!"
 ab_swe_northern_crusade_title: "The Northern Crusade"
 ab_swe_northern_crusade_desc: "As the faithful Catholic rulers of Sweden, it is our divine duty to spread the light of Christianity to the lands shrouded in darkness. The Northern Crusade beckons, calling upon our mighty armies to embark on a sacred quest to eradicate the pagan nations that dwell in Scandinavia and the Baltics. This mission aims to bring salvation to the heathen souls and establish our righteous dominion in these lands."
 ab_swe_laponia_title: "Secure Laponia"
 ab_swe_laponia_desc: "The Sámi of the cold, lonely north are uncivilised and strange people. Reindeer herders, barbaric snow-treaders and most importantly, heathens. Surely, they will be better off under our rule, knowing the glory of Christ."
 ab_swe_finland_title: "Conquer Finland"
 ab_swe_finland_desc: "The ancient and wise Finnish, uncivilised yet dignified all at once, deserve to know Christ’s wisdom. No longer shall they clamour under dark foliage, lost in the barren pines - under our protection, they will join Christ’s flock!"
 ab_swe_hakkapeliitta_title: "Integrate the Hakkapeliitta"
 ab_swe_hakkapeliitta_desc: "We’ve noticed that our newfound Finnish subjects make marvellous light cavalrymen when provided equipment, training and (regrettably) food. The Hakkapeliitta, as they are referred to, would make an excellent and ferocious addition to our forces."
 ab_swe_fall_denmark_title: "Christianize Denmark"
 ab_swe_fall_denmark_desc: "The Danes are an ancient and formidable rival. They stand as the gatekeepers of the Baltic, guarding doggedly the stepping stones that connect Germany to Scandinavia. Their faith in their old and twisted ways is strong, but we have found that Christ can break any chain, no matter the strength."
 ab_swe_bane_of_the_hansa_title: "Bane of the Hansa"
 ab_swe_bane_of_the_hansa_desc: "The Hansa stands for nothing but greed. They are an ill-gotten rabble of merchants who would gladly sell out their own for simple coin. Judases, in all but name - despite all their wealth and connections, they would sooner see their pockets full than Christianity flourish in the cold north. Enough is enough!"
 ab_swe_viking_fleets_title: "Rival the Viking Fleets"
 ab_swe_viking_fleets_desc: "The accursed Vikings, the eternal enemy of our conversion efforts and the dominant force in Scandinavia, are renowned for their horrific naval might. Their dreadful ships lay waste to coastal villages, render to ashes innocent ports and have tarnished many a city with their might. Enough is enough - this maritime strength must be countered and crushed, once and for all!"
 ab_swe_pirates_title: "Seize Visby"
 ab_swe_pirates_desc: "Visby, while renowned as a powerful trade port and gateway to Gotland’s interior, is also the greasy den of insidious Vikings and wily pirates. These fools have plagued our adjacent coastlines and terrorised the Baltic as a whole without end. They must be quelled!"
 ab_swe_religious_mission_title: "Religious Mission"
 ab_swe_religious_mission_desc: "We must not stand idle. The good word must be spread. With diligence, our holy men will work to advance the Kingdom of God."
 ab_swe_order_title: "Establish the Carolean Order"
 ab_swe_order_desc: "Total conversion is not enough. In an age of confusion, misalignment and heresy, the Kingdom of God must be conserved, protected, balanced. Let us establish and spread the Carolean Order, for as long as good resides unchallenged in our hearts, evil shall never triumph."
 ab_swe_sound_toll_title: "Control the Sound Toll"
 ab_swe_sound_toll_desc: "The Sound Toll, a mercantile gateway that bridges the cold North Sea and the frigid Baltic, lies within our hands at long last. However, it has certainly seen better days. Pour some golden coins, heavenly devotion and a dash of preferential treatment to our own merchants and we will surely make Sweden richer!"
 ab_swe_vikings_title: "Rout the Vikings"
 ab_swe_vikings_desc: "The accursed Norwegians have terrorised God's good world for long enough. Let us claim these desolate mountains and treacherous shorelines for the Kingdom of God. New pastures and peaceful farmlands will prosper beneath our banner and his protection. No longer shall this land know the violent rage of the Berserkir. Wolves shall be tamed - rendered an innocent flock of sheep."
 ab_swe_sea_markets_title: "North Sea Markets"
 ab_swe_sea_markets_desc: "With unchallenged control over the North Sea's most predominant port cities and entrepots, we have potential to stand as a mercantile superpower. We must rebuild the old Viking marketplaces, revitalise the trading outposts, provide ample and safe lanes of trade to and from our ports. Only then shall we stand tall."
 ab_swe_king_title: "King in the North"
 ab_swe_king_desc: "We are now the predominant trade power in the North Sea. The Hansa has been brutally subdued and the Vikings are no more. We are lions of the North!"
 ab_swe_stormaktstiden_title: "Stormaktstiden"
 ab_swe_stormaktstiden_desc: "Never before has Scandinavia known such total hegemonic control. Norway, Sweden and more stand beneath our banner - united in faith, overflowing with Coin and a true Kingdom of God on Earth. The Stormaktstiden is at hand - a Scandinavian Empire, through and through!"
 ab_swe_noteborg_title: "Found Nöteborg"
 ab_swe_noteborg_desc: "To the southeast of Finland are ample, rich and lush marshes, rife with rivers, lakes and localities fit for our empire's unending expansion. Uncivilised as these bogs stand, there is great potential for expansion. Our burghers propose a brave and vital new settlement, Nöteborg, to serve as a gateway to this frontier. We shall build it!"
 ab_swe_baltic_warfleet_title: "Baltic Warfleet"
 ab_swe_baltic_warfleet_desc: "As a beacon of Christendom in Scandinavia and the Baltic as a whole, we have a special duty to claim naval superiority in the region. Heathens of all flavours run rampant, sullying God’s Earth, threatening to persist in their foul ways and even expand their territories, God forbid. Starting with the frigid waters of the Baltic, Christ’s word must flourish, carried by maritime power!"
 ab_swe_riga_title: "Archbishopric of Riga"
 ab_swe_riga_desc: "Riga stands lonely in a sea of heathen dangers. We cannot let this vital city fall into unkempt, unfaithful hands. Riga must remain within the Kingdom of God!"
 ab_swe_orders_title: "Establish the Orders"
 ab_swe_orders_desc: "The Baltic is a wild and dangerous place, yet surely it may be civilised yet. From all over Christian Europe, valiant devoted volunteers - perhaps merely opportunistic and bored, but God may sort them out in the end - pour into our borders, ready to fight the good fight. Let us grant them a new frontier, a new challenge, a new untamed place to teach of the Lord's wisdom."
 ab_swe_danzig_title: "Seize Danzig"
 ab_swe_danzig_desc: "Attempts at civilising the unkempt and deranged forests of Prussia have failed utterly. The Hansa, the Germans and more have peppered the coastlines with pathetic attempts at guiding these fools to the light. No more - with Christ in our hearts and the Lord’s breath filling our sails, we will make landfall. We will civilise this land for good, starting with Danzig!"
 ab_swe_colleges_title: "Marine Colleges"
 ab_swe_colleges_desc: "With our unchallenged control over the North Sea and Baltic, as well as our long history as a sailing, water-bound people, we must empower our knowledge and let it proliferate. Marine colleges must be founded so that the next generation of sailors is all the more knowledgeable than the last. The wisdom of the previous generation must not be lost - warriors of the high seas, marines as they are called, must be trained!"
 ab_swe_iceland_title: "Control the North Sea"
 ab_swe_iceland_desc: "The North Sea's most cold and treacherous reaches are vital stepping stones to greater expansion. For centuries, the Norwegians have lorded over these distant and isolated domains, having a monopoly on the lands told of in the sagas. No longer - Sweden deserves these mythical and lost islands!"
 ab_swe_greenland_title: "Return to Greenland"
 ab_swe_greenland_desc: "In old times, our ancestors sailed far and wide. The sagas speak of great adventures to unknown lands - some said to be true. One of these is that of fabled Greenland - an icy and desolate place to the far northwest. It would be best to reclaim these lost wastes and bring some civilisation back to the coastline, lest this rightful clay fall into the wrong hands!"

# Reforms #
 magyar_tribal_union: "Magyar Tribal Union"
 magyar_tribal_union_desc: "Magyars are organized into a decentralized confederation of tribes that is officially ruled from Szeged, the seat of the Árpád dynasty. However, the central rule is very weak, which paralyzes the Magyar's ability to do anything but fight among themselves for the seat of the Grand Prince."
 mgygyula: "Revive Gyula and Kende"
 mgygyula_desc: "Magyar kingship was once divided between the sacred king, or Kende, and the military leader, or Gyula. This unique form of split governance allowed us to better adapt to military circumstance, while maintaining legitimacy. Let us revive this ancient tradition."
 mechanic_mgy_coruler_yes: "Select a §YCo-Ruler§! on monarch death. They will provide your ruler with the fourth personality trait at half efficiency."
 mgytaltos: "Empower the Táltos"
 mgytaltos_desc: "Similar to Shamans of other faiths, the Magyar Táltos are humans of supernatural abilities. Known for their spiritual powers of révülés they often serve as a bridge of communication between the gods and spirits and the Hungarian people, warning of impending doom. Granting them more privileges should inspire a certain amount of confidence amongst our armies."
 mgygreek: "Greek Liturgical Language"
 mgygreek_desc: "Our conversion to Orthodoxy has allowed us to tap into the vast Greek literary culture of our southern neighbors. This allows us to maintain a pace of rapid modernization."
 mgyslavic: "Slavic Auxiliaries"
 mgyslavic_desc: "While us Magyars are superb horseman, there are many more demeaning jobs in the army that need to be filled. Just as the Avars before us, or as our forefather Attila did with the Germans, we must recruit Slavs to fill ranks."
 mgyispan: "Ispán Marches"
 mgyispan_desc: "As one of the last pagan realms in Europe, our Christian neighbors are always looking to invade us if given the chance. Assigning border lands and their respective fortresses to court officials known as Ispán will allow us to maintain a strong defensive position against all our would be enemies."

# Decisions #
 form_magyars_title: "Reunite the Magyar Tribes"
 form_magyars_desc: "Ever since our entry into the Carpathian Basin, the Magyar people have been ruled by the Árpád dynasty. However, while they promised conquest and glory, all they have broguht us was defeat and dishonor. It is time the Magyar people are united under the leadership of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], who shall lead our nation to greatness." 

# Events #
 magyar_events.5.t: "Settling Transdanubia"
 magyar_events.5.d: "When our ancestors entered Pannonia centuries ago, they sought to unite it all under the Magyar rule. Although they came close to achieving that goal, the defeat at the Battle of Pozsony forced our ancestors back behind the Danube, where we have stayed ever since. After centuries of internal struggle, we have finally managed to achieve a great victory over the Slavs of Pannonia, and have secured Transdanubia for ourselves. Now, we must decide the fate of the area."
 magyar_events.5.a: "We shall move the tribes across the Danube."
 magyar_events.5.b: "Let us integrate and protect the locals instead."
 magyar_events.6.t: "Gyula and Kende"
 magyar_events.6.d: "Our old ruler has passed, and while the Magyar tribes mourn his passing, the time has come for the new Grand Prince to select his new co-ruler. As we have reestablished the ancient tradition of the Gyula and Kende - a dual leadership that once guided our people in times of both war and peace, the choice must be made to elect the one who will step forward to claim this title."
 magyar_events.6.a: "Select someone skilled in administration."
 magyar_events.6.b: "We could use a diplomat."
 magyar_events.6.c: "Only the strong should rule!"
 magyar_events.7.t: "A New Capital"
 magyar_events.7.d: "Now that we control the Carpathian Basin, many voices within our realm have suggested that the seat of power should be moved to a more central location. In order to better project our influence over these lands, we must consider relocating the capital. The settlement of Buda, located near the ancient Roman camp of Aquincum, seems to be the most promising candidate for the new capital of our expanding domain."
 magyar_events.7.a: "Let us move our capital to Buda!"
 magyar_events.7.b: "Our capital is fine where it is"

# Missions #
 mgy_rise_of_the_horde_title: "Rise of the Horde"
 mgy_rise_of_the_horde_desc: "The time has come! Should we not arise from our pathetic infighting, we will be crushed and eradicated from living memory, like so many steppe peoples of old. We must start by restoring our army to its rightful strength!"
 mgy_conquer_nitra_title: "Conquer Nyitra"
 mgy_conquer_nitra_desc: "Left unattended, the meddlesome Moravians stand liable to seize the vulnerable lands of Carpathia. These lands are our own - as are those they believe themselves rightful to! Nyitra is a rich and prosperous land filled with metal, gold and wine - treasures for our deserving men!"
 mgy_moravian_deathblow_title: "Moravian Deathblow"
 mgy_moravian_deathblow_desc: "Centuries ago, the Moravians once ruled an empire. They soon stumbled and fell to their knees however. Opportunists as we were, we struck at the buffoons, hoping to seize Pannonia for ourselves. Before we could solidify rule however, the Franks crushed us at the Battle of Pozsony. Ever since, we have feared to transgress upon the Danube - shying at the mention of western expansion. This must be avenged and corrected!" 
 mgy_conquest_of_the_homeland_title: "Complete the Honfoglalás"
 mgy_conquest_of_the_homeland_desc: "Upon our fated arrival in the Carpathian Basin, it seemed self-evident that if we were to survive and persevere as a people, we would have to secure the region in its totality. Setback after setback has prevented us from reaching the zenith of the conquest. Now however, we are on the cusp - and once we are over it, Magyar identity will be forever solidified."
 mgy_break_the_slavic_bridge_title: "Break the Slavic Bridge"
 mgy_break_the_slavic_bridge_desc: "For centuries now, we have hungrily eyed the plains of Pannonia. It narrowly slipped through our fingers in the 10th century thanks to a spiteful Frankish incursion. Now that we are resurging in strength and determination, Pannonia seems vulnerable - perhaps it is fated to be ours after all."
 mgy_subjugate_the_romanians_title: "Romanian Subjugation"
 mgy_subjugate_the_romanians_desc: "Not even a century ago, we held Romania in our hands - lording over their unruly masses as their rightful masters, until those indignant Bulgars disturbed us. Under our wise ways and stern discipline, they were prospering! Happy, even! Probably happy, at least. Eh. They shall be happy again under our control!"
 mgy_return_to_etelkoz_title: "Return to Etelköz"
 mgy_return_to_etelkoz_desc: "Deep within our old history are tales of the land of Etelköz - a place where the rivers meet by the fateful Black Sea. There, our ancestors allowed their horses to graze until it was time to continue their great journey to our present homeland. Having gained a strength like no other, we now have the chance to retake this land, put our horses to rest their once again."
 mgy_ruin_ruthenia_title: "Ruin Ruthenia"
 mgy_ruin_ruthenia_desc: "A spiteful rabble of Slavic peoples rage about the river Dnieper and its humble offshoots. Miserable under the looming Tatar Yoke, they have developed a certain aversion to those of the steppe disposition. We must show them what benevolent and wonderful masters we can be! Their cities are simply too big - they could do with being trimmed! Their coffers are simply too heavy - they could do with being emptied! Such is our wise and merciful rule."
 mgy_challenge_the_borjigins_title: "Challenge the Borjigins"
 mgy_challenge_the_borjigins_desc: "Perhaps the most fearsome of all the free peoples, the Mongols have made a terrible mark upon the world. From the depths of mystical Asia to the precipice of cold Europe, their blight has been irrevocable. Countless millions have suffered - city dwellers, grain peasants and free tribes alike have toiled and wasted away beneath their cruelty. It would not only be an honour for us to contest and destroy them, but a mercy to the entire world."
 mgy_back_to_the_motherland_title: "Back to the Motherland"
 mgy_back_to_the_motherland_desc: "Many, many centuries ago, in a time before memory, our ancestors lived on the wild and free steppe. Forced by circumstance to begin migrating elsewhere, they soon happened upon the home we today know as the Carpathian Basin. We are sure though that despite our present successes, our ancestors would smile proudly upon us if we were to reclaim our first homeland proper."
 mgy_defeat_the_bulgars_title: "Defeat the Bulgars"
 mgy_defeat_the_bulgars_desc: "Ever since we first arrived in the Carpathian Basin, many centuries ago, we have had to endure the wrath of the Bulgars. Old rivals of ours, they have even suffered a similar history to us - migrating from the old and mystical steppe to find a new life in the Balkans. Such, they have been our eternal rivals, a thorn in our side. It is time to remove this thorn for good - and burn it!"
 mgy_sack_the_second_rome_title: "Sack the Second Rome"
 mgy_sack_the_second_rome_desc: "The Romans! Since time immemorial they have dwelt in that gilded city with those walls oh so high, occupying the bridge between ancient Asia and fabled Europe. Many a people have tried to take it to varying levels of success. We shall be the ones to conquer it for good!"
 mgy_balkan_domination_title: "Balkan Domination"
 mgy_balkan_domination_desc: "Along with the Bulgars, the assorted tribes, petty kingdoms and merchant localities of the Balkans have meddled with our affairs for too long. Many a fantastic raid south has been thwarted by a meddlesome mission for mercy. Should we dominate the Balkans once and for all, we would secure our southern flank and be able to drawn upon the plethora of manpower and resources for ourselves." 
 mgy_imperial_incursion_title: "Imperial Incursion"
 mgy_imperial_incursion_desc: "As with the Battle of Pozsony, the Holy Roman Empire, a lumbering beast of civil peoples masquerading as deities, has time and time again bloodied our nose. They have a tendency to unite and smash us at our most vulnerable, cowards that they are. With our strength on the rise, we must strike back - deal them a blow that puts them on the back-foot."
 mgy_pillage_the_west_title: "Pillage the West"
 mgy_pillage_the_west_desc: "Having dealt the Holy Roman Empire and its meddlesome princes a mortifying blow, the way lays open for further incursions. Our eager generals have identified a host of vulnerabilities within their eastern frontiers, as well as paths to the north in the wild and untamed lands of the Wends. We would be fools to not exploit them."
 mgy_reform_the_tribes_title: "Reform the Tribes"
 mgy_reform_the_tribes_desc: "Though the tribes are the pride of our culture, of our history, they have always had a tendency towards disunity. Cohesion is not the rule - it is a state we have always had to muster, encourage and enforce. So easily have the tribes questioned our word and jeopardised our conquests. We must put a stop to this and formally reorganise the tribal hierarchy." 
 mgy_rule_eastern_europe_title: "Rule Eastern Europe"
 mgy_rule_eastern_europe_desc: "With powerful footholds in Poland and the Balkans respectively secured, we may now turn our attention to Eastern Europe in its totality. These lands are flat and vulnerable, with little in the say of great powers and organised polities. If we do not destroy and assimilate these peoples, then someone else will." 
 mgy_composite_cavalry_title: "Composite Cavalry"
 mgy_composite_cavalry_desc: "Cavalry has been a fixture of our culture for many centuries - dare we say it, millennia. Though we have turned our energies to learning new technologies, new techniques, new tactics, we have never abandoned our greatest strength - that is, our unmatched command of horseback combat. We must not let this tradition go to waste - we must empower it!"
 mgy_selective_breeding_title: "Selective Horse Breeding"
 mgy_selective_breeding_desc: "Our ancestors spoke extensively on the cultivation of our herds - advising us, many centuries later via song and tradition alike, to breed out weakness in our mounts, to cherish endurance, tenacity, speed and loyalty in our steeds. By twining our martial prowess with a tradition of selective breeding, we may create the finest array of horses the world has ever seen."
 mgy_scourge_of_god_title: "Scourge of God"
 mgy_scourge_of_god_desc: "May the peasants of Europe, Asia, the world over, come to know us by the same name, under different Gods - that of his scourge, that of the great death to make their petty fortresses tremble."
 mgy_overpower_the_hordes_title: "Overpower the Hordes"
 mgy_overpower_the_hordes_desc: "Out in the depths of Central Asia, we meet likeminded tribes - people of steppe, riding brazenly on horseback. Though these cultures share more in common with us than the Balkan peasants we are accustomed to, they eye us with contempt - seeking to compete with us, not befriend us. We must destroy them before they destroy us!"
 mgy_mongol_subjugation_title: "Mongol Subjugation"
 mgy_mongol_subjugation_desc: "Once ruling a steppe empire greater than anything that has come before, the Mongols now sit in a disenfranchised, squabbling state - not dissimilar to what we were, not too long ago! Unfortunately, the sun has set on this tribe - we are the cruel night that will put them to sleep."
 mgy_burn_the_dragon_throne_title: "Burn the Dragon Throne"
 mgy_burn_the_dragon_throne_desc: "Tales have long told of a great and vast empire sitting beyond the eastern horizon. We've always known of the riches of the Silk Road, exploited it and traded with it to no end - but never could we have fathomed its source. The cities of China are truly a marvel to behold, even from afar - we cannot imagine what manner of riches we may seize by launching our own invasion."
 mgy_great_stables_title: "Great Stables of Szeged"
 mgy_great_stables_desc: "Szeged's Great Stables - a timeless fixture of our beautiful Békés - have done us well, but as our armies have grown and our conquests have unfolded, we have come to rely on them more and more. Thus, they are in dire need of an expansion to continue serving our needs."
 mgy_highway_of_doom_title: "Highway of Doom"
 mgy_highway_of_doom_desc: "The success of the great hordes, such as the Mongols, was not merely in their swift and fearsome warriors, but in the infrastructure that sustained them. They built vast networks of roads and waystations, such as the Caravanserai, allowing their mounted armies to move at breakneck speed, rest, and strike at will. It is time we take a lesson from these masters of warfare. Our new road system will bring doom to all who stand against us. Let none escape the shadow of the Magyar horde!"
 mgy_recruit_riders_title: "Recruit New Riders"
 mgy_recruit_riders_desc: "Across our realm, young men yearn for a place in our armies. Unfortunately they lack in experience, strength, equipment and training. Where they lack however, we may provide, by constructing new stables, barracks, training fields. As the peasants grow their grain, we grow our warriors - we thus need farms!"
 mgy_military_infrastructure_title: "Expand Military Camps"
 mgy_military_infrastructure_desc: "Sizeable as our military infrastructure is, it is still meagre when compared to that of greater Europe. Owing to their coin and admittedly functional institutions, they have financed camps and academies of impressive scales. If we could copy some of their designs, we could surely boost our manpower in no time."
 mgy_supply_the_horde_title: "Supply the Horde"
 mgy_supply_the_horde_desc: "We face unique problems as a horde. Namely, our armies are always on the move - where they move, they do so incredibly quickly, often outpacing not only our enemies, but our own supply chains, too. To cope, we must build an efficient chain of military rations and goods, as well as a means of quickly building supply depots in vital locations."
 mgy_religious_dispute_title: "Matters of Religion"
 mgy_religious_dispute_desc: "The Pagan Koppany and the Christian Vajk - baptised Stephen - once fought a brutal and sad war over the Basin's religious destiny. Centuries on, we eye Europe's current religious squabbling with nervous uncertainty. We do not want another such war of our own. We must secure our religious identity swiftly, whatever it may be."
 mgy_black_soil_title: "The Black Soil of Pannonia"
 mgy_black_soil_desc: "Our ancestors dutifully noted, upon arriving in Carpathia, that the soil here is of a peculiar quality - begging for a wise and benevolent farming people to come and respect its worth. We would be fools to neglect it. While our armies raze and rampage abroad, our more peaceful population can tend to the ancient land and provide for the country."
 mgy_basket_title: "Breadbasket of Europe"
 mgy_basket_desc: "With agriculture booming by our hand, we stand to become a powerful exporter of grain in Europe, a breadbasket, as Egypt is to the arid south. Not only will we wield unprecedented military prowess over the continent, but so too will we be richer than even the most wily merchants."
 mgy_intercontinental_trade_title: "Continental Trade"
 mgy_intercontinental_trade_desc: "Sitting at the end of the Silk Road, joining the trade of Asia to the reaches of Europe, we have an opportunity to monopolise, to cast a watchful eye upon all that passes between. Like the hordes of old, we will be benevolent masters of trade - profiting as a result."
 mgy_the_magyar_yoke_title: "The Magyar Yoke"
 mgy_the_magyar_yoke_desc: "It is time to show the remaining Rus' principalities the might of the Magyar horde. Just as their ancestors once knelt before the Mongols, so too shall the last of these independent states bow before our rule."
 mgy_grip_over_the_steppe_title: "Grip Over the Steppe"
 mgy_grip_over_the_steppe_desc: "In order to forge a stable nomad empire spanning the steppes of Eurasia, we must ensure that the nomadic people of the steppe treat our great horde as their own."

 LTV_ideas: "Litvin Ideas"
 LTV_ideas_start: "Litvin Traditions"
 LTV_ideas_bonus: "Litvin Ambition"
 ltv_first: "Patriarchate of All Rus'"
 ltv_first_desc: "Our righteous monarch has proven himself to be a more capable wielder of religious authority than any of the corrupt Rus princes. Let us invite the Patriarch of Kijevas, who administers the eastern rite to all faithful Rus, into our land, so that he may work in peace and stability."
 ltv_second: "Recruit the Druzhina"
 ltv_second_desc: "It was the Druzhina that traditionally formed the armoured core of the Rus Princes' armies. Now that we rule the traditional lands of Rus, we can prove our legitimacy by enlisting displaced Druzhina."
 ltv_third: "Conquest of Rus'"
 ltv_third_desc: "Upon our adoption of the true faith, we claimed responsibility for reunifying the disparate principalities within the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Kijevas. Thus, the lands of Rus must be ruled by the Litvin ruler!"
 ltv_fourth: "Adopt the Cyrillic Script"
 ltv_fourth_desc: "The Cyrillic Script is used by speakers of various slavic languages, including the Rus, whom we now rule over. In order to ensure positive relations and ease of communication with our subjects, we should record our own language in Cyrillic as well."
 ltv_fifth: "Life-Long Conscription"
 ltv_fifth_desc: "The Royal Litvin army shall differ from the forces of our rivals in that our soldiers will serve for life. The tradition of tribal warriorship rooted in our past shall not die with our Christianization, and one of the aspects of this tradition is a lifetime of war."
 ltv_sixth: "Enlist the Cossacks"
 ltv_sixth_desc: "The Cossacks are semi-nomadic bands of horse-mounted Rus living in the southern and eastern frontiers of Ruthenia. Their unparalleled skill on horseback and remarkable perseverance will make them excellent auxiliary cavalry units in our army."
 ltv_seventh: "The Balto-Slavic Tradition"
 ltv_seventh_desc: "Over the decades, the kingdom of Litvina has developed a unique culture that synthesises aspects of Baltic and Slavic societies. This amicability between diverse groups has created a multi-ethnic patriotism held by all citizens of our Kingdom. Each man in our realm, from Vilnius to Kijevas, is willing to lay down his life for the crown."
 ltv_first2: "Patriarchate of All Rus'"
 ltv_first2_desc: "Our righteous monarch has proven himself to be a more capable wielder of religious authority than any of the corrupt Rus princes. Let us invite the Patriarch of Kijevas, who administers the eastern rite to all faithful Rus, into our land, so that he may work in peace and stability."

 ltvc_first: "Conquest of Rus'"
 ltvc_first_desc: "Lithuania has been gifted with a great destiny - that of overthrowing the malevolent Rus', and establishing our state as the most powerful in the Baltic. It shall be easy to resettle these lands once they are under our control."
 ltvc_second: "Legacy of the Crusades"
 ltvc_second_desc: "Our identity was shaped by Catholic fervour, and the wars that came with it. Our survival is entirely dependent on the strenuous defence of our faith. Deus Vult!"
 ltvc_third: "Lithuanian Magnates"
 ltvc_third_desc: "Support from the nobility is key in all of our military endeavours; with the aid of the aristocracy, at a moment's notice an army of the people can be deployed in the face of Satan's battalions."
 ltvc_fourth: "Papal Blessing"
 ltvc_fourth_desc: "Lithuania's first Catholic kings were appointed and crowned by the Pope, whose support for our cause remains unwavering to this day."
 ltvc_fifth: "Mending the Schism"
 ltvc_fifth_desc: "Clearly the reason for a Great Schism in Christendom is the lack of strength and resolve in those supposed to defend it. By strength alone will we impose upon the heathens and heretics the true will of God."
 ltvc_sixth: "Found the University of Vilnius"
 ltvc_sixth_desc: "A centre of scholarly learning like few in our region, the University of Vilnius is a staple in our nation's technological advancement. Minds from across Lithuania and all the Baltic come to our capital for the purpose of unravelling the mysteries of the Universe."
 ltvc_seventh: "The Balto-Slavic Tradition"
 ltvc_seventh_desc: "Having lived together as neighbours, even through our quarrels over matters of faith we've grown to recognize the Slavs as our brothers. So long as we follow Jesus Christ's true word, our customs do little to separate us in the grand scheme of things if we're all fighting for the same thing - the supremacy of God over all of His enemies."

 lit_seventh: "Wealth of the Amber Road"
 lit_first_desc: "For centuries, Germans, Swedes, and Rus alike have deigned to encroach on our holy forests, burning our temples in cowardly raids that they pretend are 'crusades'. Let our army be a living wall between our faith and those who wish to see it destroyed."
 lit_second_desc: "Since ancient times, Baltic warfare has been dominated by the use of convenient fortifications constructed out of already existent hills that dot the landscape. These forts are much cheaper to maintain than castles, and can more easily be deconstructed and rebuilt."
 lit_third_desc: "At a crucial junction in Lithuanian history, our great King Mindaugas rejected a papal offer to convert his kingdom to Christianity, instead choosing to maintain the ancestral faith of our people. While this made him a target of Christian hostility, he became an everlasting hero of our nation."
 lit_fourth_desc: "There exists a brotherhood between the Baltic ethnicities that runs deeper than that of any other cultural group. Our shared faith, history, and perseverance in the face of adversity have truly forged a permanent bond between the Baltic peoples."
 lit_fifth_desc: "Centuries before the formation of the Lithuanian, Pruthenian, or Latvian states, Baltic people organised themselves into tribal confederations. By maintaining aspects of our previous tribal administration we can ease the burden of governing a large land area."
 lit_sixth_desc: "The bolts of the storm god Perkunas rained down upon his enemies in ancient times, just as our arrows descend upon our foes, striking fear into the hearts of the most hardened foreign soldiers."
 lit_seventh_desc: "The amber road is the most vital artery of baltic trade, having served traders of amber and other goods for centuries. This ancient route delivers reliable wealth to the towns of Lithuania, ensuring continued prosperity."

# Reforms #
 lit_restore_amber: "Restore the Amber Road"
 lit_restore_amber_desc: "Millennia ago, a wizened road stretched from the frigid Baltic to the sweetened shores of the Mediterranean. It was made not of stone, but knowledge - knowledge eroded today, but not completely forgotten. It carried not men, but amber - a coveted good eras ago. If we could restore this network, it could carry much more than amber and reach much farther than the Mediterranean..."
 lit_warriors_perkunas: "Warriors of Perkunas"
 lit_warriors_perkunas_desc: "The great Perkunas, god of storms, god of the awesome and destructive phenomena of lightning and thunder, driver and herald of victory, bravery, sky and heavenly fire itself... he is the god that our warriors worship. He is the god that our warriors flock to - not some whimsical, all-encompassing 'father'. No... Perkunas answers our loyalty - and with each victory, our morale and devotion grow stronger."
 lit_new_model: "New Order Regiments"
 lit_new_model_desc: "Our unique government, our unique culture and our unique position in Europe has allowed us certain advantages but also certain challenges. Logistical challenges unique to our position and strengths arise every day - as a result, our army must take on a composition unmatched, a discipline unmatched and a size unmatched. Quality and quantity must be wielded in equal measure to create a fighting force to match our many enemies."
 lit_crusader_nobility: "Crusader Nobility"
 lit_crusader_nobility_desc: "It seems only fitting that the nobility within our country be composed of the crusaders which have flocked to our banner. God does good unto those who have done good unto the world - and our diligent crusades have surely brought His word into many a heathen forest. How better to both encourage our crusaders and ensure a supply of future crusaders than by rewarding the men who come our way?"
 lit_spread_cyrillic: "Spread the Cyrillic Script"
 lit_spread_cyrillic_desc: "Across Eastern Europe, the script of the Bulgarians dominates. Known as Cyrillic, it poses a fierce competition to the likes of the Arabic and Latin scribblings that oftentimes disgrace our eyes. Should we embrace it wholeheartedly, we could integrate our country into the Eastern European region proper and encourage better the spread of new ideas and information."
 lit_power_tsar: "All Power to the Tsar"
 lit_power_tsar_desc: "Under His word, the Tsar has the power. Likewise, in any worthwhile state, a strong leader is best-suited. A strong leader and a strong, succinct chain of command ensures efficiency, administrative cohesion and a certain atmosphere of dread to those woefully inefficient or unworthy of holding office. Such is absolutism - and such is the way of God."
 lit_federation: "Balto-Scandinavian Federation"
 lit_federation_desc: "For centuries now, the Christian world has wrought havoc upon the Pagan world. Not only have our ancient woods been encroached upon, roots upheaved and desecrated, but so have the olden mountains of Scandinavia, riddled as they are with foreign barbarians. Funnily enough, it seems we have more in common with those so-called barbarians than we do with Christians - perhaps it would be best to welcome our fellow Pagans under our banner."

# Events #
 ab_lithuania.1.t: "The Future of our Nation"
 ab_lithuania.1.d: "After our unification and conquest of our surrounding neighbours, every prominent aristocrat was invited to the capital to debate the future of Lithuania. From our homelands are the Romuvans who wish to keep true to the old faith and unite all other pagans against the armies of Christ. From the Polish lands are nobles and priests who claim there is much to be had in Catholicism, and that the Pope is willing to grant us many boons to convert. Finally, Ruthenians and other Eastern Slavs claim that the best course of action is to be baptised under Orthodoxy to help rule our new eastern lands. Whatever the choice, it is up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide our future."
 ab_lithuania.1.a: "We will follow Dievas!"
 ab_lithuania.1.b: "We will follow the Patriarch!"
 ab_lithuania.1.c: "We will follow the Pope!"
 ab_lithuania.2.t: "The Unification of Baltoscandia"
 ab_lithuania.2.d: "Centuries have passed, and the only peoples to remain true to the old ways are the Northmen, the Balts, and the West Slavs. The rest of Europe has fallen to Christian ways and have been attempting to subvert our beliefs too. Now, we are united as one against our common enemy. We will be crowned as Emperor of Baltoscandia and lead our own crusade against the Christians. We will prove that we are greater than the sum of our parts."
 ab_lithuania.2.a: "United we stand!"
 ab_lithuania.12.t: "A New Tsardom"
 ab_lithuania.12.d: "Our continued conquest of Orthodox lands and crusade against the remaining pagans in the Baltics have proven to the world that Litvinia is the new Orthodox superpower. No longer shall disencouraged Orthodox followers look towards the failing Caesars in East Rome. Instead, we shall claim the mantle of Caesardom for ourselves. Our glorious leader will now be known as the Tsar of Litvinia, and the glory of Orthodoxy will spread even further beyond."
 ab_lithuania.12.a: "God Save the Tsar!"
 ab_lithuania.13.t: "Rex Russiae" #Litvinia Catholic Tsardom
 ab_lithuania.13.d: "Ever since our Baptism all those years ago, the Pope has kept a close eye on our progress on spreading the true faith eastwards. Every pagan or heretic that has gotten in our way has fallen, and now we hold a vast empire in the east. The Pope has called upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] to grant them a new title worthy of their rank. With the crown placed upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head by the Holy Father, they will forever be known as Rex Russiae, King of the Russians."
 ab_lithuania.13.a: "Deus salve Rex!"

# Missions #
 lit_infiltrate_title: "Infiltrate Livonia" 
 lit_infiltrate_desc: "The upstart Dukes of Livonia refuse to recognize our right to rule over all of the Baltic. While we could just march straight into Livonia and conquer it by force, it would be wiser to do some reconnaissance. Once we have charted the best path to Valmiera, we will strike!" 
 lit_centralize_title: "Centralise the Duchy" 
 lit_centralize_desc: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] leases out large swathes of land to lesser dukes to ease the burden of ruling, but this has left us weak with no way to enforce our will on our subjects. Lithuania will be centralised once more under one strong [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]." 
 lit_secure_livonia_title: "Secure Livonia" 
 lit_secure_livonia_desc: "With the duchies reintegrated and the spy network in place, the time has come to fully reunite the Lithuanian lands. The [LVA.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] will hang for their rebelliousness and Livonia will become a permanent part of Lithuania." 
 lit_seize_riga_title: "Conquer Riga" 
 lit_seize_riga_desc: "The Archbishopric of Riga is a crusader state established not too long ago to spread the light of Catholicism to the Baltics. Fortunately, their mission was a failure and now they exist as a small Hanseatic city surrounded by Lithuania. Germans have no home in the Baltics, and we will kindly show them the way out." 
 lit_west_title: "Encroach on the Crusaders" 
 lit_west_desc: "Early successes against Pruthenia have resulted in a surge of morale for our armies. The crusaders are eyeing up the Pruthenian land and we must act quickly to prevent them from becoming too powerful. Once Pruthenia is under our control, the Prussians are next." 
 lit_seize_danzig_title: "Seize Gdanskas" 
 lit_seize_danzig_desc: "The last remaining crusader state in the Baltic is the Republic of Danzig, who claim the entirety of Pruthenia as theirs. This once proud Romuva city is now a city of decadence ruled by the Barbarous Germans, loyal only to money and nothing else. The light of the Romuva faith must be restored to Gdanskas and the Germans evicted." 
 lit_defeat_pruthenia_title: "Defeat Pruthenia" 
 lit_defeat_pruthenia_desc: "Pruthenia to our west is the only other real Romuva power in the Baltic. Sadly, their failure to reconquer Gdanskas from the German crusaders proves they are too incompetent to remain independent. To prevent any further success from the crusaders, Pruthenia must be taught a lesson." 
 lit_future_title: "The Future of our Nation" 
 lit_future_desc: "The Baltics are united, our foes have been defeated and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s central authority has been asserted. Now the question remains of what will Lithuania become? Lithuania could stick to her roots, uniting all the Pagans together under one flag to resist the onslaught of Christians from east and west. Lithuania could pursue a closer relationship with the Orthodox Rus to the east, and work together to defeat the Mongol threat. Or perhaps Lithuania could accept the ways of the Crusaders, and fulfil the goal of the Baltic Crusades and destroy Paganism in Europe." 
 lit_unite_baltic_title: "Unite the Baltics" 
 lit_unite_baltic_desc: "The last remaining roadblock in our way towards Baltic domination is the Suomenusko Duchy of Estonia. While religiously and culturally different from us, they still share the Baltic Heritage that the Lithuanians and the Pruthenians share. They will love to be part of our growing Duchy." 
 lit_konigsberg_title: "Found Karaliaucius" 
 lit_konigsberg_desc: "The Pruthenian city of Tvanskte is the perfect location for a new capital of our realm. Located right on the amber coast and along the path of major trade routes, it would be foolish not to locate the Lithuanian realm around it. Karaliaucius will become the city of cities in the Baltic." 
 lit_forest_title: "Clear the Forested Areas" 
 lit_forest_desc: "Much of our land is vast forest that is not suitable for development. To continue our expansion, we need to chop down as many trees as possible to construct bigger and bigger cities across Lithuania. Surely nobody will miss a few trees in a few hundred years or so." 
 lit_marshes_title: "Tame the Marshes" 
 lit_marshes_desc: "Another major issue with Lithuania is the sheer amount of marshes that spread across our land. The terrain is unfavourable for humans and clearing marsh is not cheap in any way. But we must persevere to ensure that our people can expand and prosper. The Marshes of Lithuania will bow to our industrial might and make way for new cities across the land." 
 lit_countryside_title: "Develop the Countryside" 
 lit_countryside_desc: "As much as we would hate to admit it, Lithuania is a poor realm compared to those of the west and east. Our lack of centralization and development has resulted in a disunified and poor population of farmers. Clearly, something has to be done to overcome this. The first step is to expand the farming countryside so there will be food to support growing Lithuanian cities." 
 lit_seat_title: "Seat of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]" 
 lit_seat_desc: "Every great empire has a famous capital. Rome and Constantinople for the Romans, Babylon for Alexander, Aachen for the Franks, yet Lithuania has no grand capital to call her own. While it will be costly, the capital of Lithuania must be developed and funded to mark our place in history as one of the empires to exist." 
 lit_pirates_title: "Deal with the Pirates" 
 lit_pirates_desc: "The pirates in Gotland constantly raid the entirety of the Baltic. If we truly are the masters of the Baltic, then they must go, once and for all. Gotland will bend the knee to Lithuania, and we are sure a few pirates would gladly serve us and raid our rivals." 
 lit_monopolize_title: "Musu Jura" 
 lit_monopolize_desc: "The Roman Empire had the Mediterranean as their own personal sea, trade flowed from Hispania to the black sea unimpeded. The continual growth of our navy has given us the opportunity to make the Baltic our own sea. From Finland to Pruthenia, Lithuania will rule the seas!" 
 lit_ports_title: "Baltic Trade Ports" 
 lit_ports_desc: "Just owning a merchant fleet does not mean we will gain all the benefits of trade. Foreign merchants still need somewhere to stop and trade if we want to profit from them. Developing small coastal towns into thriving trade cities will propel Lithuania into the future as a major trade player across the Baltic."
 lit_merchant_title: "Build a Merchant Fleet" 
 lit_merchant_desc: "Trade is necessary for any emerging state to thrive. Without it, we might not have the wealth to expand into our neighbours. To help ensure our traders have a fighting chance against the Hanseatic league and other Baltic naval powers, we need to construct a merchant fleet to support them. If not, we might not ever reach our full potential." 
 lit_amber_title: "Restore the Amber Road" 
 lit_amber_desc: "In ancient times, merchants from the Mediterranean and further south would travel up to the Baltic to purchase amber from the Balts. While it has been some time since the road has been used, we still possess a large quantity of amber to trade. A new series of roadways will be constructed across Lithuania to promote the amber trade once again." 
 lit_lechitic_title: "Lechitic Conquest" 
 lit_lechitic_desc: "The Polish to the south have been split for centuries, and their struggle for reunification has yet to finish. This is the perfect opportunity for Lithuania to expand without much resistance from another major power. Poland will make a fine addition to the ever growing collection of cultures under the Lithuanian Flag."
 lit_eliminate_novgorod_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Eliminate Novgorod[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_eliminate_novgorod_desc: "The fury of the Romuva shall be unleashed, and our first target shall be our biggest rival to the east, Novgorod. Conquering their capital and coast will forever banish them into irrelevance and begin our ascension as a pagan superpower!" 
 lit_white_sea_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Secure the White Sea[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_white_sea_desc: "The frigid waters of the white sea rarely sees any trade, but the Novgorodians have been focusing on developing a trade city to help promote trade in these desolate waters. Luckily, they are in no position to stop us from seizing this new trade port for ourselves." 
 lit_rival_sweden_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Rival Sweden[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_rival_sweden_desc: "Other than Novgorod, the only Christian power that threatens us in the Baltic is the crusader kingdom of Sweden. If we dawdle too much, they might become too powerful for us to handle. Constructing an invasion fleet to land in Stockholm and evict the crusaders is paramount to our goals." 
 lit_finland_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Conquer Finland[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_finland_desc: "The Finns are a proud people who have resisted every attempt at subjugation against them. Neither the Russians to the east or the Swedes to the west could conquer them. But it takes a pagan to conquer a pagan, and the Finns will love being a part of our empire." 
 lit_recruit_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Recruit the Hakkapeliitta[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_recruit_desc: "The Finns, while living in one of the coldest environments on Earth, have developed spectacular light cavalry tactics. Their ability to harass and flank their enemies while also serving as frontline horsemen makes them incredibly valuable to any general. It would be a major mistake to treat the Finns as second class citizens and deny ourselves these amazing soldiers." 
 lit_purge_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Purge the Christians[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_purge_desc: "The Catholic Swedes are an atrocity to every paganin the Baltic. Their need to proselytize their beliefs by peace or force has only weakened the Baltics, and now we must undo their damage. Every Swede will learn the light of our holy Romuva faith, or die by our sword." 
 lit_norway_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Unite with Norway[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_norway_desc: "The Norse and Romuva gods are not so different deep down. Perhaps there was once a common belief that diverged, or perhaps we simply want more land. Whatever the answer is, the shipwrights of Norway are the most renowned in the world, and bringing them into our fold will benefit both parties." 
 lit_toll_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Control the Sound Toll[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_toll_desc: "The time has come, the most crucial toll in all of Europe has long been under the hands of the Danish. Their continual influence over the Baltic ends today. Once the Sound Toll is under our control, all the trade in the Baltic will flow through us, making Lithuania fabulously wealthy." 
 lit_baltoscandia_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Unite Baltoscandia[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_baltoscandia_desc: "At first, the Baltic was united under our banner. Every Lithuanian, Pruthenian, Estonia, and Livonian rejoiced. But we did not sit idly on our laurels. We pushed further, kicking the Christians both east and west out and united all the remaining pagans in Europe. Now, we haunt Europe as a spectre of the pagan past. The glorious lands of Baltia and Scandinavia stand as one, Baltoscandia will dominate the North Atlantic forever!"
 lit_control_pomerania_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Subjugate Pomerania[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_control_pomerania_desc: "The Wendish have resisted German crusaders for the past few centuries, their tenacity and dedication only proves how capable of a people they are. Sadly, they can not resist the Germans forever, but we can help them. Lithuania shall rule over the Wendish and ensure that their culture and faith never fades into history." 
 lit_destroy_hansa_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Destroy Hansa[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_destroy_hansa_desc: "The Hanseatic League is the root of all of our problems in the Baltic. Their constant trade embargos and invasive trade cities attempt to subvert pagan power in the region. Taking their two most important cities of Lübeck and Hamburg will finally deal the finishing blow to the League, and bring peace and prosperity to our new empire." 
 lit_bane_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Bane of the Teutons[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_bane_desc: "The Germans pride themselves on their military prowess, but they have clearly shown nothing but incompetence and failure for the past few centuries. Their so called grand crusades and eastward push resulted in very little land conquered from the pagans. We will show them what true military ingenuity and power looks like, and burn down their pathetic empire." 
 lit_raiders_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Raiders on the Storm[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_raiders_desc: "The temporary employment of former Raiders from Gotland resulted in a massive increase in profits thanks to their raiding expertise. Sadly, most of these Gutnish raiders have died out or retired, and the Christians are starting to sleep soundly at night again. We should analyse what made them so effective, and then apply it to our newly formed raider group." 
 lit_temples_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Shrines of the Old Gods[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_temples_desc: "The Baltic pantheon has been the official state religion ever since the reunification of Lithuania not so long ago. Most of the population practice the faith personally at home. This has created the issue of minor deviations between cities over just what each god represents. State sponsored shrines and temples run by an organised clergy will teach our people in the proper ways to practise our faith." 
 lit_reconciliation_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Pagan Reconciliation[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_reconciliation_desc: "The pagan faiths of the north all share some similar practices and beliefs. While this is not enough to justify united all the faiths into one, it is enough for us to tolerate them. One thing we all do share in common is our hatred for Christians and their constant Proselytising and crusades. We will tolerate the other pantheons of gods; and in return, they will give us their finest warriors to slaughter the Christians."

 lit_complete_conversion_desc: "We have stated our intention to follow the Orthodox faith, as such, we must work to convert those in our lands who do not see lord Christ as their saviour, nor wish to. This will be a challenge as in the past we have mostly tolerated our people's religions but that will now change. The Romuva and other pagans will have no refuge here. And for those who flee south seeking refuge and safety in other nations of the faith, they will soon find our armies marching towards them."
 lit_cultural_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Cultural Assimilation[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]"
 lit_cultural_desc: "With the people of our lands now following the one true faith, now arises the need to address the different languages spoken within our lands. Our lands encompass not only Lithuanians, Byelorussians, Latvians, and other groups as well. However, these languages are not too different from each other, so our ruler had the brilliant idea to have the scholars of the nation work on codifying a new language, taking inspiration from all three to be used in matters of state and day to day conversation. a language, not of the Lithuanians or any other singular group but of the Litvins."

 lit_invade_rus_desc: "With the most important internal matters of the nation addressed, our people now dream of more conquests and the fragmented Rus' seems ideal for this. Once united under a single banner, it shattered before the might of the Mongols and it hasn't been able to unite since those days. If the Ruthenians are unable to consolidate their own state, why shouldn't we dream of one day conquering the entirety of Ruthenia?"

 lit_secure_novgorod_desc: "Novgorod is one of the most important cities in Eastern Europe, from its role as a major trade hub to the grandeur of its cathedrals and the role it played in teaching the princes of the Kievan Rus' how to rule, Novgorod is a city that has few superiors. Its conquest will bring wealth to our people and serve as a springboard to even greater things."

We should press our advantage and continue our expansion whilst we still can. We are the successors to the Rus'! And we will earn that title by Right of conquest!"

 lit_new_tsardom_desc: "Litvinia has come far from its humble beginnings as Lithuania. First we fought to conquer the other Baltic states, then we addressed the matter of faith and the identity of our people. Afterwards came the conquest of most of Ruthenia, then even further east, into the Ural mountains and to the South into Cossack lands. We are now more powerful than the Rus' ever was! bastion of Orthodox Christianity! However our work is not done yet, we cannot revel in this victory whilst there are still meddling princes plotting against us. All of Ruthenia will bend the knee to it's true masters and when that happens, the Tsardom of Litvinia will be born!"

Great warriors, with their own way of life that follows the Orthodox faith, living off of what their land gives them and fighting tooth and nail against those who try to take their land. These men and their fighting spirit would do wonders for our army and as such we should convince as many of them as we can to enlist in our army."

Whilst not the easiest, pushing all the way to the Urals would be the best solution, a way to guarantee our flank is covered by natural defences and should the opportunity come, will even allow our people to settle beyond the mountains in the future."

However the conquest of Finland will bring one benefit to us, it'll be our line of defence against the Swedish heretics, a military frontier against the catholics."

Let us crush their belief once and for all, to finally prove to them that protection and salvation can only come in the form of Christ."
 litc_mother_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]The Mother of Cities[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]"
 litc_mother_desc: "Kijevas has long been regarded as the preeminent city of the Rus. From its founding as a viking outpost centuries ago, Kijevas has rapidly grown, with no other city matching its power. As the capital of the titular Kievan Rus, the city also grew to possess a symbolic role as the cultural hub of the Eastern Slavs. However, with its sack by the Mongols, the area was devastated, and much of its splendour was ruined. But with the Mongol retreat allowing it to grow, Kijevas has once again risen to prominence, and its strategic position is undeniable too. With our own patronage we can rebuild the city to surpass its previous power, and make it our new, shining capital."
 litc_bread_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Breadbasket of Europe[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]"
 litc_bread_desc: "Ruthenia has always been a highly productive agricultural region, but with the Mongol Invasions and the subsequent period of endemic warfare following its prominence has declined as of late. Meanwhile our population has continued to grow, and without a stable source of food we will be forced to rely on expensive and unreliable imports. Therefore, it is of principal interest to us to restore and expand these now half-vacant lands to their true potential, that of one of the most productive granaries in the world."

 litc_westernise_navy_desc: "We have learned much from our friends in the Crusaders, but due to our formerly landlocked status we have precious little experience with shipbuilding.

 litc_moravian_intervention_desc: "Svatopluk of Moravia was the greatest ruler of the Moravians, and under him it could briefly claim greatness. But, his successors turned from the true path and dealt with the treacherous Greeks, who sought to divide the Holy Church and squander its progress. No more! The decadent Moravians have long suffered in their split from his holiness the Pope, and we shall take it upon ourselves to bring them back into the one true church, by force!"

 litc_wendia_desc: "The Wends have long been a thorn in the side of Christian Europe since the time of Charlemagne, and their continued raids have long threatened the existence of Christendom in the Baltic.

 litc_complete_conversion_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Complete the Conversion[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]"
 litc_complete_conversion_desc: "Our baptism by the Pope himself may have convinced the elites to follow Christ, but the peasantry remains mostly unaware and uninterested in our new faith. Indeed, many prominent figures in the church have cast doubt on our sincerity, believing we merely converted to appease the Crusaders who long troubled us. But we shall show them our mission is true, our resolve and faith are absolute, and we will show our people the light."
 litc_cultural_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Cultural Assimilation[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]"
 litc_cultural_desc: "With the greater emphasis on our connections to our brethren in the Rus, and their rise to great positions of prominence in our state, our court will become more vibrant and diverse. Ruthenian and Byelorussian dialects are now as common as Lithuanian in the halls of our monarch, and their formal status as equal partners in the state is necessary. Already it seems that something new is emerging. Not quite Lithuanian, but not fully Rus either, the cultural blending in our nation can reach its most brilliant, if only we allow it to grow."
 litc_legacy_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Legacy of Kievan Rus'[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]"
 litc_legacy_desc: "The Kievan Rus was shattered long ago, but its memory remains deeply embedded in the minds of the people. The Mongols even in their death throes have strived to prevent a new power rising in the West, but we shall show them their folly. They could not break us even as they conquered many far-off and powerful lands, and now we will reverse their greatest triumph in Europe. We shall bring order and peace as the successors of the Kievan Rus, and from Kijevas the light that will convert the East shall shine forth."
 litc_invade_rus_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Invade Ruthenia[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]"
 litc_invade_rus_desc: "With our conversion complete and the realm stabilised, we may now turn Eastwards. The lands of the Byelorussians are vulnerable, with the once-mighty Kievan Rus gone. Ruthenia is still recovering from the Mongol onslaught, and thus a prime target for expansion. The power vacuum in the Rus has led to much chaos in Ruthenia, and if we wish to rise as a power we must make a move on Belarus."
 litc_ural_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Reach Ural[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]"
 litc_ural_desc: "With our hold on the greater part of the Rus secure and the claim to the Kievan Rus secured, we must turn further eastwards. The lands North of the Steppes are a diverse place with immense wealth of natural resources. Claiming these bountiful but underutilised lands for ourselves will serve to reinforce our economy, and perhaps set the stage for expansion even further into the unknown East."
 litc_rex_rusiae_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Rex Russiae[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]"
 litc_rex_rusiae_desc: "Now that our claim to the legacy of the Kievan Rus is secure, we must strive for the final unification of all Rus peoples under one nation. With that monumental achievement and the blessing with his holiness the Pope we shall be able to claim the title of not just the Kievan Rus, but something far, far greater."
 litc_secure_novgorod_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Secure Novgorod[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]"
 litc_secure_novgorod_desc: "Secure in our faith, we must continue the mission of the Crusaders to the lands of Novgorod. This den of schismatics has long been tolerated due to the Westerners' preoccupation with the Pagans, but our conversion has allowed the Crusades to extend farther than ever before. By uprooting this outpost of idol-worshipping heretics we can finally bring Novgorod into the holy Church, or at least make some profit from taking over their valuable trade connections."
 litc_finnish_frontier_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]The Finnish Frontier[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]"
 litc_finnish_frontier_desc: "The Finns have long been secure in their lands, content to herd and practise their heathenous religion while the Swedes fought the Nordic Pagans to a standstill. We shall take up the cause of a Finnish Crusade and establish for ourselves a bulwark in the North to guard against any attempt at a Pagan incursion Westwards."
 litc_cossacks_title: "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Tame the Steppes[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]"
 litc_cossacks_desc: "The wild fields of the Pontic steppes have long been a springboard for invasions into Central and Eastern Europe. With the partial retreat of the latest Nomadic invaders of the Mongols, the region is largely unguarded. We should strive to secure this vital chokepoint for ourselves, both to curtail the unruly Cossacks and protect Christendom from any future Eastern threats."

 SLU_fourth_desc: "The Estonians have had naval traditions going back almost as long the Norse. It is no secret that they have defended their coasts from all manner of pirates and barbarian in part due to their experienced naval leaders. We should use the Estonians for our own fleet, and once and for all strike down the Norse raiders for good."

Your warriors shall paint their shields and their armors with your symbols, your callings. They shall be your finest men; not to murder and pillage like those vicious, blood-thirsty Christians, but to defend the world so generously gifted to us. Every warrior will fight with the fury of thunder, and the deafening crash of blades and spears that follow in their wake!"
 krz_second: "Great Deeds and Good Faith"
 krz_second_desc: "To those of great Christian Europe, what do they have to show for their piety and devotion to their one God? A legacy of violence and barbarism! We tend to our cities, nestled deep within our forests, while legions of maddened young men march to their doom for fractured kingdoms and duchies. We will be better. Our cause is righteous, and all will know the will of the gods - we shall not make a desert and call it peace, but create a garden of piety for our realm."
 krz_third: "Vanquisher of Slavs"
 krz_third_desc: "Lo, the sons of Rus! Divided, they cannot stand against our tide. Fallen, they join as a multitude of peoples under our empire. Their resistance is stiff, but as they are many, we must treat them with a gentler hand. For a while, their language and cultures will remain - perhaps even their deluded faith, until tensions simmer and no longer does the sound of bloody warfare ring across the plains and forests of this land. Only when they understand that our rule is total will they bend the knee, in understanding that we shall forevermore be the masters of this place."

Every corner of our empire, from the smallest villages to the sprawling metropolises, will know who their new masters are. They are not the children of that 'one true God', but the servants of many! In time, the Slavic peoples will become unto us, at long last united under a single banner."
 krz_fifth: "River Trade Routes"

We possess resources in abundance, and it is no surprise at all that wealth pours in from all directions. Muslim merchants in the East make little distinction between Christians and Romuva, as one has replaced the other, and even those in the West, who decry us as barbarians, now happily travel to the gates of our resplendant capital, seeking whatever we can provide. We will be this beacon between worlds."
 krz_sixth: "Integration of the Kazakhi"
 krz_sixth_desc: "These Christian Slavic men of the south, in those wild fields south of Krievzemia, have remained a thorn in the side of all invaders ever since their inception. Neither the Golden Horde nor the shattered remnants of Rus' could tame them. We, however, are an overwhelming force. Just as easily we could root out these parasites and burn them away from our lands, but it would do us no good. An offer, then: these Kazakhi will join us, their cavalry joining ours, so long as they convert."

So many times have they attempted to tear us out from our homes, burning our lands, our people, that they recant their faith, and even their very language.

Latvia, her land, her people, has experienced a miraculous turnabout. It shall no longer be the age of Christian domination, but the return of Saule's light! Long live Krievzemia!"

 form_kalevalia_desc: "The enemy encroaches upon our forests and lakes from every direction. From the east, the Rus' press ever westward. From the north and west, the Norsemen raid and settle our coasts. From the south, crusaders march with fire and iron, seeking to shatter our ancient ways. No longer shall the tribes of the Finnic people remain scattered and divided. We must stand as one, not as clans, but as a nation. Let the world know this name: Kalevalia. The eternal land of song and steel!"

 smi_destroy_the_oppressors_title: "Destroy the Oppressors"
 smi_destroy_the_oppressors_desc: "The vile heathen have invaded our lands and desecrated our holy places. Their effort to destroy us has forced us to abandon our peaceful way of living and now, the time for vengeance has come."
 smi_noaidi_title: "Blessing of the Noaidi"
 smi_noaidi_desc: "The Noaidi, the Shamans who serve as the medium between the Realm of the Living and the Dead, form a very influential part of our society. Their ritualistic drums bestow upon them the ability to communicate with benevolent spirits, and thus, are highly revered. To ensure the favour of the Spirits and blessed fortune, the unwavering support of the Noaidi is essential."
 smi_protect_the_sacred_lands_title: "Protect the Sacred Lands"
 smi_protect_the_sacred_lands_desc: "While the territories under our control are  a pious land, the lack of temples dedicated to our Gods presents a great concern to our Shamans. To avoid the wrath of our Lords from manifesting into disaster for our people and tribe, we must initiate the construction of temples across our realm."
 smi_shrine_of_ukko_title: "The Shrine of Ukko"
 smi_shrine_of_ukko_desc: "Our skies, once blue and lively have been covered entirely by grey clouds. Ferocious and untimely thunderstorms strike across our realm, which the shamans interpret as the wrath of Ukko, the mighty God of Thunder. The Ylijumala can no longer be satisfied with the offering of the sacred Vakka. Perhaps erecting a Great Temple dedicated to his worship, sanctified under the shroud of the holy Rowan, will quell his anger and allow us to atone for our transgressions."
 smi_reform_the_faith_title: "Reform the Faith"
 smi_reform_the_faith_desc: "In its present state, our faith is one in name only, as the many regional and cultural differences among it's followers has left any hope of a unified doctrine dashed. By formalizing a defined clerical and theological structure to our faith, we can ensure that it persists through the test of time."
 smi_tame_the_reindeer_title: "Tame the Reindeer"
 smi_tame_the_reindeer_desc: "To the Sami people, the spiritual significance of the Reindeer extends beyond the continuation of livelihood. Seen as the provider of warmth and the link of humans to nature, our subjects have fostered a deep connection with the animal. As Reindeer husbandry continues to grow as a profession, we must ensure that the Chief focuses on developing the regions where the trade can prosper."
 smi_the_reindeer_cavalry_title: "The Reindeer Cavalry"
 smi_the_reindeer_cavalry_desc: "As tactics and weaponry evolve across Europe, many military thinkers within our nation have proposed a novel idea: utilizing the Reindeer as a mount for our cavalry officers. By selective breeding and nomadic practices, we may obtain variations of the Finnish forest reindeers capable of hauling large weights, and thus aid us in our wars. Our enemies shall tremble upon hearing the gallop of these majestic, furred beasts!"
 smi_warriors_of_sapmi_title: "Warriors of Sápmi"
 smi_warriors_of_sapmi_desc: "The Sami possess a proud tradition, a tradition of resistance against those who have tried to force us into servitude. Yet, our Chiefdom now faces existential danger from the heathens who surround us, who seek to destroy our faith, and the Finns to the South, who are eager to end our sovereignty. All those who consider these forests their home, shall join our ranks and defend this land until Olmai calls upon their soul."
 smi_finns_title: "Unite with the Finns"
 smi_finns_desc: "Beyond the mighty Kemijoki River lies the Kingdom of the Finns, a land of rigid order and governance. While they pride themselves on their structure, our people have been tempered by struggle, our armies forged into seasoned warriors. With the tide of history on our side, the time has come to bring the Finns under our banner, not as equals, but as subjects of a greater destiny."
 smi_liberate_karelia_title: "Liberate Karelia"
 smi_liberate_karelia_desc: "Our brethren in Karelia live under the brutal occupation of the Novgorodians. Any Sami who does not bow before their false Lord is put through excruciating torture, to break the mind and body, and eventually, the faith. Let us mount an expedition and cross the Kola Peninsula, and put an end to the malevolent rule of the Veche over the Karelians once and for all."
 smi_stronghold_of_christianity_title: "Stronghold of Christianity"
 smi_stronghold_of_christianity_desc: "For generations, Sweden has cast its shadow over our lands, marching under the banner of the Papacy to break our spirit and erase our faith. They burn our villages, silence our shamans, and call it salvation. But their zeal will shatter beneath the fury of the north. We shall rise, cast them from our lands, and show them that the soul of Sapmi bows to no cross."
 smi_strike_against_the_norse_title: "Strike Against the Norse"
 smi_strike_against_the_norse_desc: "For too long, the Norse have encroached upon our lands, raiding our villages and defiling our sacred sites. Their dominance across the northern seas has made them bold, but their arrogance will be their undoing. It is time to rally our warriors, sharpen our blades, and strike back against their tyranny. By reclaiming what is ours, we shall remind the Norse that the heart of the Sami people is unyielding, and we shall not bend before their tyranny."
 smi_dismantle_norway_title: "Dismantle Norway"
 smi_dismantle_norway_desc: "As the Jarldom of Norway stands on it's final knees, her craven and weary soldiers have begun preparing a feeble defense of their remaining holdings in Scandinavia. In their weakened state, a well-planned offensive may be enough to shatter their morale and declare victory. By the will of Ukko, our warriors shall rain thunder upon the heretics and put an end to the Viking farce."
 smi_into_the_baltics_title: "Into the Baltics"
 smi_into_the_baltics_desc: "The great city of Tallinn finds itself under the rule of the Paijkull. While our tribes share much in common, from faith to governance, it is clear that their wretched family has brought only misery to the people of Estonia. To realize the oneness of all those who follow the way of the Ylijumala, and to reap the profits from the ever-expanding Baltic trade, bringing the region into our fold is necessary."
 smi_pacify_novgorod_title: "Pacify Novgorod"
 smi_pacify_novgorod_desc: "With the loss of Karelia, Novgorod has suffered defeat after defeat—not only at our hands but also against rival kingdoms. Once, their armies outnumbered and outmatched ours, but now the final remnants of Russian resistance crumble beneath our advance. Their vast treasury lies within reach, ripe for the taking. By seizing Novgorod, we will secure not just wealth, but also a rightful claim to subjugate the fractured princedoms of the Rus."
 smi_ascendant_kalevalia_title: "Ascendant Kalevalia"
 smi_ascendant_kalevalia_desc: "As our tribe grows, so do its ambitions. From humble beginnings in the forests of Sapmi, we have conquered and united the Finns and Estonians under our banner. Our enemies' crowns and thrones crumble beneath the weight of our warriors, as the strength of the old ways overtakes the rigid rule of monarchs. The rise of Kalevalia marks not just the union of lands, but the return of tribal might over fragile kingdoms."
 smi_devastate_the_rus_title: "Devastate the Rus'"
 smi_devastate_the_rus_desc: "The Russian princedoms stand on their last legs! Centuries of oppression under the iron grip of their boyars shall be repaid in kind. Our campaign shall not be one of conquest, but rather one of punishment, for our Gods shall lend us their strength to hail devastation upon their cities. The Volga shall be our newest domain and the  people of the Rus' shall be eternally cursed to suffer the same hell they once imposed upon us!"
 smi_fury_of_the_north_title: "Fury of the North"
 smi_fury_of_the_north_desc: "Our tribe, once considered by the so-called great powers of Europe to be a ragtag group of scavengers and hunters now stands at the cusp of complete hegemony over the Norther lands. From Viipuri to Schleswig, we have brought unification upon this fractured land, and now we shall look outwards. Our enemies see us as nothing more than raiders, but we shall prove them wrong. We are the Spirit of the North, the vessels of fury which can only be possessed by people whose greatest foe is no man, but nature itself."
 smi_the_winds_of_winter_title: "The Winds of Winter"
 smi_the_winds_of_winter_desc: "Winter is a cruel and unyielding force, sweeping across the land with merciless fury, leaving nothing but frostbitten ruins and silence in its wake. Just as the cold spares none, neither shall we. With the howling blizzards at our backs and the will of our Gods guiding us, we shall march forth, conquering at the scale not seen since Alexander. The people of these lands have a choice - to submit or be blasted away by the inevitable hailstorm."
 smi_the_viking_dawn_title: "The Viking Dawn"
 smi_the_viking_dawn_desc: "The Vikings, unpredictable and erratic have provoked the wrath of our Chief by extending their raids onto our territory. No goodwill can exist between our honest people and these heathens, who are driven by the lust of blood and gold. Let us bring about an end to their domination over Scandinavia, and usher in a new era for the region free from the clutches of the Norsemen."
 smi_the_baltic_union_title: "The Baltic Union"
 smi_the_baltic_union_desc: "While the tribes of the Baltic continue to bicker among themselves, the Christians have seized the opportunity and embarked on a crusade against our brethren and continue to convert them at the tip of the sword. To prevent any further interference by the Papists, we must declare a dominion over the Baltic, a union to ensure that our common interests are safeguarded. Together, we shall defend our ancestral lands, preserve our traditions, and establish a lasting hegemony to ward off foreign invaders and their zealous ambitions."
 smi_sapmi_revival_title: "Revival of the Sámi"
 smi_sapmi_revival_desc: "Once a proud and thriving people, the Sámi have been driven to the forests of Lapponia, living in the shadow of Swedish Crusaders and Russian raiders. Yet our spirit endures, and it is time to rise above the fear and subjugation of centuries past. We must reclaim our ancestral lands from foreign occupiers, revive our sacred traditions, and ensure that our people’s identity and heritage remain unbroken. Let us secure a future where Sápmi belongs to the Sámi once more."
 smi_forest_title: "Tame the Boreal Forests"
 smi_forest_desc: "For centuries, the dense boreal forests of the North have been the lifeblood of the Sámi people. Every aspect of our society—our economy, traditions, and governance—has been shaped by these untamed woodlands. Now, as our realm grows in strength, we must harness their full potential, transforming them from mere sustenance into the foundation of a thriving, enduring nation."
 smi_fur_title: "Expand the Fur Trade"
 smi_fur_desc: "The fur trade is the lifeblood of our economy, employing countless hunters, skinners, and merchants across our lands. As the European beaver faces a huge decline in population, the demand for Reindeer fur has surged drastically, presenting us with a unique oppourtunity. By investing in trade infrastructure and expanding our networks, we can cement our dominance over this lucrative market, ensuring that our coffers overflow with gold for generations to come."
 smi_white_sea_title: "Control the White Sea"
 smi_white_sea_desc: "The Russian settlers, or the Pomors have transformed the desolate forests surrounding the White Sea into great trade ports, establishing a lucrative exchange network with Scandinavian and English merchants. Now, with our dominance over the fur trade firmly established, we stand poised to seize the full wealth of these waters. By securing the harbors and regulating commerce, we shall ensure that the White Sea becomes the beating heart of our growing northern empire."
 smi_preserve_our_heritage_title: "Preserve Our Heritage"
 smi_preserve_our_heritage_desc: "Sámi folklore, a testament to our virtues and piety, has been passed down orally for generations. Yet, without action, our roots risk fading into obscurity. Inspired by the Renaissance sweeping Europe, we must document our legends and wisdom, ensuring the survival of our culture for future generations."
 smi_enlightenment_title: "The Sámi Enlightenment"
 smi_enlightenment_desc: "Our Chief is neither a tyrant nor a lord, but rather a guardian of the Sami peoples, under whose benevolent rule our tribe has experienced unparalleled prosperity. Embracing the ideas of Enlightenment spread across Europe, our Chief now seeks to elevate our institutions, both economic and governmental, on par with the so-called 'civilised' monarchies of the West. Soon, great universities shall rise across our lands, transforming our realm from one governed by anarchy to one run by code and honor."

 prr_appease_the_old_gods_desc: "Unlike much of Europe, we in the Baltics still cling to our native faith. Let us embark on a grand temple building program, to remind all of the Livonians who their gods are."
 prr_defend_against_christendom_title: "Defend Against Christendom"
 prr_defend_against_christendom_desc: "Our faith is pressured on all sides by Christian aggressors, waiting for a sign of weakness to pounce. We must show the Christians that we are not to be trifled with. In the name of Perkunas we will strike fear into their hearts."
 prr_reform_the_faith_title: "Reform the Faith"
 prr_reform_the_faith_desc: "It is clear that our current disorganized faith will not be able to survive against the power of the Christians. We must look to reform and standardize the Romavu faith if we are to retain our old ways in this modern world."
 prr_support_the_guilds_title: "Support the Guilds"
 prr_support_the_guilds_desc: "Many trade guilds exist in our forest territory, both Native and Baltic German in origin. If we are to begin to contend with our more developed neighbors, we should lend these guilds our support, and hopefully build a powerful Livonian economic base in the process."
 prr_amber_road_title: "Revive the Amber Road"
 prr_amber_road_desc: "The Amber Road has been a staple of Northern Europe for millenia, but sadly the Mongol Invasions and new found dominance of the German traders have greatly weakened this vital trade route. We will need to restore it through great effort if we are to break free of our neighbor's dominance."

 prr_pearl_of_the_baltics_title: "Pearl of the Baltics"
 prr_pearl_of_the_baltics_desc: "Gdanskas is by far the wealthiest city on the Baltic, and now that it is under her rightful owners, we can seek to improve it further. Already a key part of our economy, with a little more investment, it could rival even the great Mediterranean trade cities of the south."
 prr_call_pagan_brotherhood_title: "Call the Pagan Brotherhood"
 prr_call_pagan_brotherhood_desc: "With Christian enemies around on all sides, the last followers of the old ways of Europe must unite if our sacred rights are to survive. Pruthenia will lead the bulwark against the oppressor."
 prr_baltic_warfleet_title: "Baltic Warfleet"
 prr_baltic_warfleet_desc: "While Pruthenia has never been known for its naval prowess, the exploitation and subjugation of our coast by both Hansa and Viking has gone on too long. It is time for the wrath of Potrimpo to be felt along the whole of the coast!"
 prr_destroy_hansa_title: "Destroy Hansa"
 prr_destroy_hansa_desc: "The Hansa has long oppressed our people through its monopolies and superior navy, often blockaded our people into starvation if it suits them, or funding brutal crusades into our territory.

 prr_control_the_straits_title: "Monopolize the Straits"

 prr_capture_danzig_desc: "While it is currently a wretched hive of scum and villainy, many forget that Gdanskas was once a Pruthenian city. Ripped from our control by the vile Hansa, if we are to seriously challenge the Hansa, we must begin with retaking the pearl of the Baltics."
 prr_seize_pomerania_title: "Seize Pomerania"
 prr_seize_pomerania_desc: "Although they are fellow pagans, the Pomeranians have proven far too weak to seriously hold back the Christian advance. We must take up the torch of Pagan resistance, and that should begin with conquering Pomerania."
 prr_wendish_subjugation_title: "Wendish Subjugation"
 prr_wendish_subjugation_desc: "While they once valiantly defended pagan borders from the Germans, the current state of the Wends is pitiful. Divided and bickering, we can no longer trust them to resist, if we are to ever push back against the Christians, the Wends must be subjugated."

 prr_crown_of_lechia_title: "Crown of Lechia"
 prr_crown_of_lechia_desc: "The warring states of Lechia are far too weak to stand against the might of Perkunas. Consolidating the fertile lands of Lechia will also help us create a wealthy and united Pagan front against the encroaching Christian menace."
 prr_overthrow_lithuania_title: "Overthrow Lithuania"
 prr_overthrow_lithuania_desc: "While fearsome in their own right, with our warriors tested against crusader metal, the Dukes of Lithuania will be no match. The conquest of the Lithuanians will also open up further Baltic domination."

 prr_unite_with_livonians_desc: "The Livonians are the last of the Balts who have not been united with us, and we should look to rectify this. In the name of the sky father Diews, we must unify the whole of the Balts if our people are to withstand for all times."

 prr_proclaim_the_baltic_union_desc: "Never unified, we Balts have often been far too weak to pose a serious threat to any would-be invaders, but this will change.

 prr_the_empires_downfall_title: "The Empire's Downfall"
 prr_the_empires_downfall_desc: "The abomination that is the Holy Roman Empire has been wavering ever since they first felt the wrath of Perkunas. Wavering is not annihilation however, and we ought to continue our conquest to assure the empire's collapse."
 prr_eradicate_the_cross_title: "Eradicate the Cross"

 prr_forest_title: "Forest Reclamation"
 prr_forest_desc: "Much of our lands are covered with impenetrable forests, and while it may have helped us defend our borders better, it also has stifled much development in our kingdom. If we are to compete with our more organized neighbors, we must develop our lands."
 prr_heart_of_the_baltics_title: "Heart of the Baltics"
 prr_heart_of_the_baltics_desc: "Although not as well known as Danzig, Tvankste is a wealthy settlement in her own right. If we can invest in our capital's growth further, surely we can establish it as the new Pearl on the Baltic."

To govern in our stead, we have assigned local Chiefs to such areas, who represent these people and their interests in a Council convened at Tallinn every couple of years. This has ensured relative stability in our realm, as compared to other Baltic duchies, along with acting as a check to the powers of the Duke. Let it be known—Pagan or Christian, Baltic or Latin—all who seek prosperity and peace shall find a home within the borders of Estonia!"

 est_guardians_of_the_gulf_title: "Guardians of the Gulf"
 est_guardians_of_the_gulf_desc: "Vaata ja kuula!\n\nThe Kingdom of Sweden and the Republic of Novgorod stand at the gates of our fledgling country. It is for certain that we must strike out preemptively to prevent ruin. Divided from our northern brothers, we will raise a fleet to return to them, and on the shores of Finland we will begin our march to the edge of the world!"
 est_safeguard_estonia_title: "Safeguard Estonia"
 est_safeguard_estonia_desc: "We are alone - but we need not be. The world is shattered and disunited. It has been since its inception, and will continue to remain so. While it lasts, other 'pagans' like ourselves, or even the Christian petty kingdoms surroundings us may be interested in a friendship of convenience. Let us reach out to the world, and draw up agreements that we will come to the aid of others, so long as they come to our aid as well."
 est_unite_with_the_finns_title: "Unite with the Finns"
 est_unite_with_the_finns_desc: "Here is a flicker of hope in these dark times. The duke of Finland has been made to kneel, and though it spilled the blood of our people and theirs to do this, it is a step on the long and difficult road to our freedom. The rest of our brothers and sisters remain to be liberated."
 est_protect_the_sapmi_title: "Protect the Sápmi"
 est_protect_the_sapmi_desc: "It is for their own good that we force the Sámi to be incorporated into our lands. They are a part of us - our people, our languages, our gods. Under the heel of a foreign oppressor, there is no doubt their culture would be stamped out and faith eroded under either the Norse gods, or the so-claimed omnipotent Christian God. They will cherish the presence of our warriors, in time, and in turn we will learn from them."
 est_liberate_karelia_title: "Liberate Karjala"
 est_liberate_karelia_desc: "The fanatic Novgorodian merchants would make certain that in time, our Karelian kin would be assimilated into their world, leaving no trace behind of what they once used to be.

 est_ascendant_kalevalia_title: "Ascendant Kalevalia"
 est_ascendant_kalevalia_desc: "Wave the blue and red flag across all the lands! For the first time in our history, we Finnic peoples have come together under one, shared country, a new identity!

Skandinaavia will tremble at the sound of our cavalry charging them down!"
 est_salt_and_herring_routes_title: "Salt and Herring Routes"
 est_salt_and_herring_routes_desc: "Among the many goods that pass through the hands of merchants in the Baltic Sea, it is fish, and secondarily salt, that has always been one of the mainstays in this region.

 est_defend_against_the_vikings_title: "Defend Against the Vikings"
 est_defend_against_the_vikings_desc: "Though the era of the Vikings has passed, their two kingdoms remain.

We will build coastal defenses to make sure that their damnable warriors will be slaughtered as soon as they arrive at our shores."
 est_harbor_of_the_north_title: "Harbor of the North"
 est_harbor_of_the_north_desc: "We have had a long maritime traditon among our people, but never quite the resources to pool to show for it. Now that we are stronger and richer, we can show the world that the sea is just as familiar to us as land. Docks and shipyards will litter the coast of Estonia, Finland and northern Scandinavia, and the churning of ships will sing in the light breeze."
 est_mare_nostrum_title: "Meie Meri"
 est_mare_nostrum_desc: "It was hard to imagine that we would one day become the masters of the Baltic Sea, the window between West and East, where a wealth of merchants travel. Now, these are peaceful waters, not plagued with pirates and raiders alike, and our reach is unsurpassed by any other contenders. Meie Meri - we thank Ahti for guiding our fleet to victory."
 est_nevas_delta_title: "Neva's Delta"
 est_nevas_delta_desc: "The bountiful and blessed river Neva reaches up to a delta where a large and prosperous city can be founded. It is, however, under the rule of the greedy and the wasteful. The Novgorodians would only waste the potential of this land. Let it be that we take what is rightfully ours, and turn it into a shining jewel."
 est_pacify_novgorod_title: "Pacify Novgorod"
 est_pacify_novgorod_desc: "The Novgorodian merchants are warmongerers, and though we have defeated them in Karelia and Neva, we are fully aware that they would never rest until our country was destroyed, utterly replaced by their banner, faith, and people. We will take the great city itself, and perhaps even reach out to a peculiar trading family within, who seem to have no qualms dealing with so-called 'heathens'."
 est_build_nevalinn_title: "Build Nevalinn"
 est_build_nevalinn_desc: "People from all over [Root.GetName] are flocking to the city of Nevalinn, a settlement that has rapidly grown ever since our conquest of it. Situated on the coast with an estuary, on grassy green lands, it presents a burgeoning second capital. May Nevalinn grow tall, and become the pillar of our corner of Europe!"
 est_livonian_lands_title: "Livonian Lands"
 est_livonian_lands_desc: "Livonia represents a natural expansion of our borders, and though they are a people that we have interacted with for a long time now. We may still be foreign conquerors to them, but they are brothers nonetheless, and will become fitting subjects for our kingdom."
 est_claim_lithuania_title: "Claim Lithuania"
 est_claim_lithuania_desc: "The Hercogyste of Lithuania stands as a dangerous threat to our sovereignty. In these fractured lands, their destiny can easily be one of domination.

 est_baltofinnic_brotherhood_title: "Balto-Finnic Brotherhood"
 est_baltofinnic_brotherhood_desc: "With the Baltics fully under our control, a sense of peace washes over this region. Pruthenians, Lithuanians, and so on - they are under our allegiance, and merciful guidance. Their faiths will be kept untouched, and all we ask of them is to come together as one to step into the future. No more will brother fight brother, but with one another instead."
 est_support_the_guilds_title: "Support the Guilds"
 est_support_the_guilds_desc: "Our long coastline is home to many trading guilds, both Estonian and foreign. Eking out a meager existence in between Viking raids and German competition, they are in dire need of support. By granting them some small investment, we can turn Estonia from a backwater into a major economic power."
 est_amber_road_title: "Revive the Amber Road"
 est_amber_road_desc: "The Amber Road has long been a staple of the Baltic economy, as far back as the Roman Empire at least, yet frequent competition from our neighbors has left the once great route destitute. While the cost is great, a restored Amber Road will be the envy of all."
 est_estonian_marines_title: "Estonian Marines"
 est_estonian_marines_desc: "Well versed in amphibious warfare from centuries of struggle against all matters of foes, we Estonians have become expert fighters along the coasts and aboard ships.
