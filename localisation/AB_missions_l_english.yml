 #Pannonia
 pnn_baptism_title: "Baptism in the Danube"
 pnn_baptism_desc: "The Magyars, despite living in the heart of Europe for centuries, still cling to their heathen practices. However, the majority of those who would call themselves Magyar share our blood and our heritage, and as our kin they can be redeemed. Thus they must be Christianised in order to save their souls and allow them to be a proper part of our state."
 pnn_river_title: "Push Past the River"
 pnn_river_desc: "The tenuous balance of Carpathia has finally been broken, as the Magyars once more try to push west, beyond the Danube. This is an existential threat, not only to us, but to the whole Slavic world. If the Magyars are not stopped here, who's to stop them at all? We must push past the Danube and secure land that hadn't been held by Slavs for centuries in order to ensure our people may have a future not under the boot of nomadic conquerors."
 pnn_inevitable_title: "Prepare for the Inevitable"
 pnn_inevitable_desc: "The status quo in the Carpathian Basin is tenuous at best. For centuries the Magyars have been kept at bay across the great Danube river, but with Moravia's power waning, they are sure to make a move. We must prepare, as conflict, at this point, seems inevitable."
 pnn_plains_title: "The Eastern Plains"
 pnn_plains_desc: "The plains of Eastern Pannonia are a far cry from the fertile lands around the Danube river. Even the Magyars have taken to referring to it with a Slavic word, 'Puszta', denoting its flat and empty character. Because of this, the Magyars found themselves right at home here, reminded of their old homelands to the east. The power of the Magyars may have been diminished, but it is not yet broken, and we must beat them in their home turf to finally be safe from their threat."
 pnn_bend_title: "The Southern Bend"
 pnn_bend_desc: "The Eastern part of the mighty Carpathian mountains surrounds the Pannonian basin from all sides as it bends southward and then westward. A mighty natural barrier, which we must secure to ensure there will be no more nomadic invasions from the East. As it happens, it is also the final Magyar holdout within our basin. Take it, and our state will finally be secure within its natural borders."
 pnn_never_title: "Never Again"
 pnn_never_desc: "Carpathia has a long history of being invaded from the East by nomadic hordes. The Huns, Avars and Magyar, all came, saw and conquered this fertile land. Times are, however, changing and we shall never let this happen again. Our eastern flank will be guarded by impenetrable fortifications and our people may finally rest easy."
 pnn_glagolitic_title: "Modernise the Glagolitic"
 pnn_glagolitic_desc: "The Glagolitic script was created by the brothers Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius in 863 to help spread the Orthodox faith in Moravia. While its use has changed over the years with conflict between Catholics and Orthodox, it still stands as the clerical script used in Pannonia. By standardising the script, we will eliminate any possibility of misinterpreting the holy scripture." 
 pnn_religious_reforms_title: "Religious Reforms" 
 pnn_religious_reforms_desc: "The Orthodox Church of Pannonia has always been threatened by the Papists in the west and Pagan hordes surrounding us from the east. The people of Pannonia need guidance in these trying times. Churches must be constructed across the lands and all priests must be convened to solidify Orthodox teaching across the realm." 
 pnn_mining_title: "Transylvanian Mining Towns"
 pnn_mining_desc: "There is great wealth hiding in the Southeastern Carpathians, wealth that has gone unexploited for far too long. The local inhabitants of Transylvania lack much of the expertise required for setting up large-scale mining operations. We must settle the region with Slavic experts from Western and Northern Pannonia in order to fully tap the riches hiding within the mountains."
 pnn_christ_title: "Christianise the Magyars"
 pnn_christ_desc: "Whether we like it or not, the Magyars have become a core part of the Pannonian basin's cultural makeup. The times of them being foreign invaders is long gone, as they have made this land their home, just as we have. Many Christian Magyars are already our loyal subjects and serve in our armies as very capable cavalrymen. It is clear that the Magyars can be civilised, but they all must abandon their old ways and be brought into Christ's embrace."
 pnn_peaks_title: "Recover Nitrava"
 pnn_peaks_desc: "Our victories against the Magyars may have bought us some time, but our position remains vulnerable. On our northern border our Moravian cousins look towards our territorial gains with hungry eyes, eager to reclaim lost glories of a past empire. While the Danube provides some defence from would-be invaders from the North, if they do manage to cross the river, our lands are open and difficult to defend. Our only option is to expand north and push towards the tallest peaks of the Carpathian mountains, which no enemy would dare cross."
 pnn_kremnica_title: "Golden Kremnica"
 pnn_kremnica_desc: "The gold mines of Kremnica have barely reached their peak potential, and we are missing out on a serious source of income. Mines must be expanded of course, but constructing a mint will allow us to mine the gold and mint out coinage at the same time. The wealth generated from this will of course go to the army, but maybe we could afford to siphon some of it to the average citizen."
 pnn_rudohorie_title: "Riches of Rudohorie"
 pnn_rudohorie_desc: "The rolling hills and mountains of the Northern Carpathians contain large deposits of gold, silver, iron and other metals, which is why the region has been named 'Rudohorie', meaning ore mountains. We should exploit these natural riches in order to arm our men and fund our campaigns."
 pnn_pannonia_title: "Fortress Pannonia"
 pnn_pannonia_desc: "The entire Carpathian basin is now in our hands and our natural borders have finally been achieved. However, even the greatest of natural barriers surrounding our lands is useless if it remains unguarded. Forts shall be built, garrisons reinforced, our armies drilled, in order to never let anyone else take what is ours from us again."
 pnn_danubian_title: "The Danubian Trade"
 pnn_danubian_desc: "The presence of the hostile Magyars has long limited the trade that flows up and down the Danube. Now that the entire Pannonian basin is firmly integrated into the Christian world, we are ready to start shipping goods on one of Europe's greatest rivers and earn great wealth doing so."
 pnn_ragusa_title: "Ragusa Trade Deals"
 pnn_ragusa_desc: "Ragusa, pearl of the Adriatic and second most famous city on its shores. The first is, of course, Venice, which also happens to be the destination of many merchants that choose to stop there on their way to German markets instead of taking the overland route through Pannonia. This has to stop. Negotiating a trade deal with Ragusa will allow us to pull trade away from Venice and towards Pannonia."
 pnn_constantinople_title: "Constantinople Trade Deals"
 pnn_constantinople_desc: "Constantinople, the City of the World's Desire. Given this title for a good reason, the great city has recently been hotly contested. No matter who came out on top, the city remains a jewel of the world, and crucial to the transdanubian trade. No matter who came out on top in the fight for the city, we must establish trade contacts and ensure that we have a great deal of control over the trade that flows from Constantinople into Europe. And if the power that holds Constantinople is a hostile one, we shall get our way, by force if necessary."
 pnn_crimea_title: "Crimea Trade Deals"
 pnn_crimea_desc: "Though we may not directly be involved in it, the Black Sea is nonetheless crucial for our trade ventures. The Danube delta is an entrypoint for the wealth of the East into Europe, and we must fully capitalise on this. Those who rule Crimea also hold great sway over the comings and goings of the eastern trade and earn great riches as a result. We must establish trade deals with the masters of the peninsula, one way or another, in order to secure our position on the world stage."
 pnn_hegemon_title: "Trade Hegemon"
 pnn_hegemon_desc: "We have done what many would have thought impossible. Though the core of our nation is landlocked, we have turned into a veritable trade hegemon and serve as a vital artery connecting Northern and Southern Europe. Now it is time to reap the rewards."
 pnn_black_soil_title: "The Black Soil"
 pnn_black_soil_desc: "Pannonia is home to some of the most fertile soil in Europe. If we take good care of it and treat it well, we may yet become a major food producer for all of Europe."
 pnn_basket_title: "Breadbasket of Europe"
 pnn_basket_desc: "By carefully managing our fertile soil we have become a true breadbasket for Europe. Pannonian grain is shipped far and wide, and Pannonian livestock is the envy of all."
 pnn_intensify_title: "Intensify the Mining"
 pnn_intensify_desc: "Vast amounts of wealth remain untapped within the mountains. The easily accessible veins of ore are running low and we must dig harder and deeper to keep up."
 pnn_develop_title: "Develop the Mining Cities"
 pnn_develop_desc: "The Mining cities of Nitra and Transylvania are a cornerstone of our economy. We must further invest into them, as the return on the investments will no doubt be worthwhile."
 pnn_heart_title: "The Heart of Europe"
 pnn_heart_desc: "Pannonia, long considered a hopeless backwater, has risen to be one of the biggest economic powerhouses on the continent, able to compete with the likes of Britannia and Francia. Pannonia is the beating heart of Europe, and it may remain so for the foreseeable future."
 pnn_mountain_title: "Fortify the North"
 pnn_mountain_desc: "Now that the we have a rich and defensible area of Nitra under our control in the north, we must start to defend it. By fortifying this area we can hope to defend the realm while also building a stronger militaristic tradition in our borders."
 pnn_diocese_title: "Diocese of Pannonia"
 pnn_diocese_desc: "While our church has grown considerably stronger in recent times, we should aim to make it stronger still. Let us seek to strengthen it's authority and its size among our subjects. In return our church will help stimulant growth in our provinces."
 pnn_slavonia_title: "Secure Slavonia"
 pnn_slavonia_desc: "If we are to secure our position, we must extend our border in the south. The fertile plains of slavonia are a prime target for this, and we can use them a spring board for potential expansion into the Adriatic in the future."
 pnn_croatia_title: "Illyrian Advance"
 pnn_croatia_desc: "By expanded into Croatia we not only destroy a potential competitor, increasing our influence in the balkans more, but we can now gain access to the lucrative Adriatic trade. With our south secure, we can begin prepartions to even invade Italy, should we desire."
 #Hetmanate
 htm_raise_host_title: "Raise the Host"
 htm_raise_host_desc: "The time has come to seize initiative. For too long, our ancient plains, once a heartland of all the peoples of Europe and beyond, have been a bloody battleground, torn between foul-breathed steppe conquerors and grovelling Norsemen. Let us raise a host of riders that will invoke fear - inspiring terror amidst not only the bustling streets of Krakow, but also the treacherous reaches of Sarai."
 htm_tame_title: "Tame the Wild Fields"
 htm_tame_desc: "The steppe is like the sea - its bountiful horizons offer freedom, fortune and an expanse beyond one's wildest dreams, though it is not composed of bountiful waves, but instead glimmering grasslands. One commonality not to be ignored, however, is the treachery and violence that may run abound in the form of bandits, Mongols and the threats of the wilderness - as well as the eternal challenge of distant rivals awaiting us past the eastern horizon. Let us dominate this wilderness, until our hetmanate is a beast for all the world to fear."
 htm_dnieper_title: "Advance Along the Dniepr"
 htm_dnieper_desc: "It is only natural that the hetmanate reclaim the mother city of Kyiv - the beating heart of the world of our forefathers. We shall brush aside the squabbling princes, thieving marauders, and greedy landowners to bring this beloved heartland back into our fold."
 htm_mother_title: "The Mother of Cities"
 htm_mother_desc: "According to the Primary Chronicle of the great Saint Nestor, Kyiv was founded in ancient times by three legendary brothers, headed by the noble Kyi. Having endured centuries of assaults, sieges, raids, escapades and humiliations, this proud city must not be allowed to decline any further. To honour the memory of Kyi and our ancestors alike, we must empower the great Kyiv, making it a booming metropolis to rival the likes of Czargrad, Novgorod and Rome."
 htm_metropolitane_title: "Metropolitan of Kyiv"
 htm_metropolitane_desc: "With our proud capital restored and elevated to previously unseen heights, rife with booming markets, raging ports, hearty garrisons and a sprawling keep for our rulers, it is only fitting that we now turn our attention to pleasing the most important and most cherished members of our hetmanate - Jesus Christ and the Lord. Let us dedicate our wealth and resources not to extravagance in the name of material, worldly deeds, but the power of the almighty."
 htm_infiltrate_title: "Infiltrate the Horde"
 htm_infiltrate_desc: "To the east, the wily Mongols gather anew - raging against internal rebellions and struggling with their rampant tribal strife. It is said that a heavy wallet can get you anywhere within their lands - so a spy network will not only prove easy enough to build, but also prove to be of massive detriment to their indecisive leadership. Let us wreak havoc amidst their ranks and prepare our revenge."
 htm_princes_title: "Unite the Princes"
 htm_princes_desc: "For too long, Ruthenia has laid divided. Outsiders have run amok, princes have squabbled and bickered, and many a prospective farmer has suffered at the hands of incessant violence beyond his control. No more - Ruthenia must come under our banner."
 htm_defy_title: "Defy the Khagan"
 htm_defy_desc: "With the Khagan's whimsical 'administration' in tatters, exposed at every level by our fearless spies, we must make haste. The peoples of Yedisan and the Crimea cry out for our liberation - let us give it to them and spit in the face of Mongol oppression."
 htm_ruthenia_title: "Reunite Ruthenia"
 htm_ruthenia_desc: "With our supremacy established and made clear, Ruthenia must respect us properly. Let us make a proclamation to all peoples of Rus' - that we are their masters and the heirs to this greatest of histories."
 htm_crimea_title: "Claim Crimea"
 htm_crimea_desc: "The Crimean peninsula stands as an intensely contested region. Goths, Byzantines, Mongols and worst of all, undoubtedly by the Devil's wicked doing, Italian traders, have laid claim to the humble peninsula - for it is a vital artery of trade and a port of great potential. Let us drive out the competition and claim the area for ourselves."
 htm_azov_title: "Conquer Azov"
 htm_azov_desc: "Azov is a humble, yet vital coastal haven. Many fertile grasslands stretch across the region's extent. Unruly steppe fiends have made it their home for far too long - it would make a much better place for our proud and hearty Cossacks to settle and make their own."
 htm_coalition_title: "Anti-Mongol Coalition"
 htm_coalition_desc: "There stands a common goal within all stricken by adjacency to the Golden Horde - freedom from Mongol wickedness. Divided, we will fall and wither away beneath centuries of oppression. Together, we may drive out our enemies once and for all. Let us forge friendships, build trust and proclaim leadership of a new coalition against the Mongol menace."
 htm_sarai_title: "Sack Sarai"
 htm_sarai_desc: "Sarai stands as a disgusting testimony - the testimony of Mongol conquest, for they have swept through a region not of their own and had the audacity to found an indignant city on the shores of a once beautiful river. Let us shatter the spirit of the horde by shattering their heart. We must ruin Sarai."
 htm_dismantle_title: "Dismantle the Golden Horde"
 htm_dismantle_desc: "Triumph echoes throughout our armies. Songs of victory are cried out across the countryside. Already, the poets weep with joy at the destruction wrought upon the Mongols, the vengeance rightfullly exacted. The battle is not yet over, however. The battle is not yet over until not a single Mongol banner stands west of the Urals. Let us carry out this obliteration once and for all."
 htm_novgorod_title: "Control Novgorod"
 htm_novgorod_desc: "Novgorod is an ancient city - founded many centuries ago to bring about peace and cohesion among proud and rowdy tribes. Today it is a vital heart of trade - ruled over by greedy and incompetent men. This proud city, boasting tidy streets, widespread literacy and rich culture, must be brought under our rule."
 htm_rurik_title: "Dethrone the Rurikovichs"
 htm_rurik_desc: "For centuries, the Rurikovichs have proven themselves incompetent. The Rus’ require a strong leader. Who better than us - we who dared to defy the Mongols, dared to reunite and gather our people, dared to stare down outside oppression and crush all who challenge us with a stampede of galliant Cossack cavalry. Let us see to it that not only these fools are dethroned, but also driven extinct."
 htm_rus_title: "Heir of Rus'"
 htm_rus_desc: "With our enemies wiped from the plate that is Europe, our borders stretching from wild east to civilised west, frigid north to treacherous south, we may finally proclaim ourselves heir of Rus'. Novgorod booms within our grasp, Kyiv glitters with gold and all the princes prosper beneath our valiant Cossack might. Finally, we may complete our conquest of Rus' - and with it, stand unchallenged forevermore."
 htm_ural_title: "Reach Ural"
 htm_ural_desc: "In the distant east, vast and formidable mountains run abound from the south, reaching the farthest, coldest north. Beyond them, our fearless Cossacks reckon, there lay untouched, unclaimed, undisturbed wilderness - trifled with by vagrants, tribes and wanderers, yes, but nothing that is a match for our unstoppable host. Let us conquer these proud mountains!"
 htm_west_siberian_towns_title: "Found New Towns"
 htm_west_siberian_towns_desc: "Siberia lays within our control, with routes, roads and villages blossoming. However, the prosperity of Kyiv, Novgorod and the other jewels of the west dwarf the sorry, humble likes of our new holdings. Let us create fully-fledged towns, making these little settlements true population centres, true cities, true homes."
 htm_west_siberia_title: "Siberian Expedition"
 htm_west_siberia_desc: "Having crossed the hardy Urals, we may finally set foot into the vast wilderness of Siberia. Cossacks stand eager to venture out east, striking into rife, virgin wilderness. Let us make haste and expand our borders where no empire has dared expand before."
 htm_east_siberia_title: "Reach the Pacific"
 htm_east_siberia_desc: "Our Cossacks have leapt from west to east and discovered, awaiting us at the other end of vast and beautiful Siberia, a seemingly endless sea - rivalling that of not only the great White Sea to the north, but even the fabled Atlantic, where Franks, Anglos and Saracens alike sail arrogantly. The coastline which lays at the behest of this cold and beautiful expanse boasts a rich fur trade - perhaps if we were to settle it, we could dip a finger in its pie."
 htm_fur_trade_title: "Control the Fur Trade"
 htm_fur_trade_desc: "Our far eastern coastline lies within our hands - but the endless hunger of our merchants is not yet sated. Our Cossacks also cry out for more adventure, their appetite proving insatiable. Let us push them into a new pursuit - that of dominance in the noble fur trade."
 htm_urbanize_title: "Urbanize the Steppe"
 htm_urbanize_desc: "Decades of warfare against the Mongols have wrought havoc upon peaceful grasslands. We sought to liberate this region from tyranny - yet the mark of warfare, the taint of bloodshed and the echoes of destruction live on. We must give back to the beaten and battered peoples of the steppe, urbanising and restoring what once was, to bring the region to even greater economic heights."
 htm_expand_title: "Expand Stanitsas"
 htm_expand_desc: "Our ambitions are plentiful and our plans for the steppe are extensive. It is only fitting that we expand our array of stanitsas - military localities - to enrich our pool of manpower with new recruits and make from our booming population new Cossacks."
 htm_reform_title: "Reform the Sich"
 htm_reform_desc: "The Sich - a gallant and decisive stratocratic military force based within the steppe - has won many a victory against and written many a devastating letter, rife with insults, to foul-breathed and pig-headed foes abroad. Its might is undeniable, its honour vast, yet it remains, admittedly, an angry and disorganised rabble. If we were to reform the Sich, however, empowering their minds as much as we do their seemingly bottomless stomachs and hunger for land and bloodshed, they could become a powerful arm of our Hetmanate's government."  
 htm_untamed_title: "Untamed Horde"
 htm_untamed_desc: "With our resurgent strength and valiant and plentiful victories, we have proclaimed to the world not only Cossack military superiority, but also Cossack hegemony. Let us create not only the largest, but also the most fearsome army the world has ever seen - and rattle, shake and shatter the bones of our enemies with terror alone. Not only the steppe, but also the conceited likes of Europe, will tremble before the Cossack behemoth we shall make of our military forces."

 ainu_colonize_pacific_desc: "Having set sail into the Sunrise Sea, we have discovered various new lands during our explorations. They seem to be sparsely populated, wild places, perfect for new settlements."

 trc_control_desc: "With the island bases of the Genoese Republic stripped from them, the city lay exposed. With it comes the control over one of the most lucrative centers of trade in the world. It is a prize irresistable to our armies."
 trc_isles_title: "Weaken Genoa"
 trc_isles_desc: "Genoa is the primary naval and trade power in the Western Mediterranean. From their rich and powerful city in Liguria, they project their reach across the many islands in the region. If we are to begin to overthrow their order, we must start with the islands of Sardinia and Corsica."
 trc_navy_title: "Trinacrian Fleet"

 trc_dalmatia_title: "Conquer Dalmatia"
 trc_dalmatia_desc: "The coastline along the Balkans known as Dalmatia is populated by many Italian speaking communities, owing to its maritime links to the peninsula. As the closest Italian kingdom to this valuable trade region, we must step in and secure it for ourselves."

 trc_tripolitania_title: "Conquer Tripolitania"
 trc_tripolitania_desc: "With much of the Mediterranean secured through conquest on land and sea, it is inevitable that we would expand our campaign against the Barbary Pirates of North Africa. Let us land in the city of Tripoli and seize the coast for ourselves."
 trc_develop_south_title: "Develop the Countryside"
 trc_develop_south_desc: "Much of Trinacria has remained devastated ever since our liberation campaign, as we had to fight with every available resource. It is time we invest into the land and make it prosperous once more."
 trc_venice_title: "Dismantle the Republic"
 trc_venice_desc: "The Venetian rRepublic has long ruled over the eastern Mediterranean as a trade empire from the Queen of the Adriatic. If we are to push forward with unifying Italy, this republic must be destroyed and its lands incorporated into our realm."
 trc_rome_title: "Roman Resolution"
 trc_rome_desc: "The Papal State and its several subjects in central Italy are a potential contender for Italian hegemon. Worse still, outright war against the leader of the Catholic world would be unforgivable. However, it is possible that they could join us as an ally in our campaigns, as this would also further legitimize our rule and continued conquests."

 ven_holy_alliance_title: "Holy Alliance"
 ven_holy_alliance_desc: "The Holy City of Jerusalem is under a threat of the Nizzarid invasion. Even though we have already guaranteed the independence of the Kingdom, perhaps it would be wise to enter an official alliance with Jerusalem and provide them with full support in the case of war."
 ven_protect_title: "Protect Jerusalem"
 ven_protect_desc: "The Sword of Islam has fallen upon the Holy City and we have been called to protect it. We must answer the call!"
 ven_alexandria_title: "Seize Alexandria"
 ven_alexandria_desc: "Our total victory against the Nizzarids grants us a chance to dictate the peace terms. If we truly wish to neutralize this threat, we should seize their capital of Alexandria which will not only weaken the Sultanate, but also give us a much needed port in the eastern Mediterranean."

 ven_sponsor_arts_desc: "If we wish to maintain our prestigious status as the most influential and most powerful Italian city, we must embrace the ideas of Renaissance and turn Venice into a safe haven for the artists and scientist inspired by it."
 ven_tribunal_title: "The Supreme Tribunal"
 ven_tribunal_desc: "Our political system is threatened by a possibility of one faction gaining too much power, which would place the Republic under their full control. A tribunal will be created, ensuring that such event will never happen."
 ven_plague_doctors_title: "Train the Plague Doctors"
 ven_plague_doctors_desc: "Plague doctors are, for the most part, amateurs. Professional physicians and surgeons tend after the most well-off, while second-rate plague doctors roam the land, tending after people who cannot afford the best treatments. Their quality varies greatly, but if we instituted a training program to provide a standard knowledge base for plague doctors, the health of people in the provinces would increase dramatically."
 ven_inculti_title: "Provveditori ai Beni Inculti"
 ven_aldine_title: "The Aldine Press"
 ven_aldine_desc: "The printing press has brought many new innovations to Venice, including the introduction of a slanted, cursive font named after the region it came from, 'Italics', and an early form of copyright protection via granting a monopoly in the production of works written in Greek. These printing innovations are sure to help sprend new ideas throughout the Serene Republic."
 ven_trieste_title: "Secure Trieste"
 ven_trieste_desc: "The wealthy imperial free city of Trieste would make a fine addition into our trade league."
 ven_arsenal_title: "Expand the Arsenal"
 ven_arsenal_desc: "The Venetian Arsenal is a venerable and key institution, responsible for the construction and maintenance of our serene state's respectable fleet. In these fluid times, it is more important than ever to make sure that the Arsenal is up to the task, by commissioning a new series of ships that will strengthen our navy and ensure our maritime supremacy for years to come."
 ven_ragusa_title: "Control Ragusa"
 ven_ragusa_desc: "Ragusa was at one point closely aligned with Venice, both politically and economically. Unfortunately, the Bulgarian savages put a stop to any further attempts at collaboration on a large scale, deeming Venetian forays into the Balkans a threat. This must stop here and now. Ragusa is Venetian and only Venetian, as it was meant to be, and the Doge's armies will make it so if they must."
 ven_aegean_title: "Reclaim the Aegean"
 ven_aegean_desc: "Although Venice had maintained a number of holdings across the Aegean, many of them were lost to bold Byzantine expeditions from Constantinople or Nicaea. More still were put under great threat by the ever-encroaching Bulgarian Empire, with little reason to maintain them in the face of overwhelming odds. It is time that the Aegean and all its wealth return to the fold, acknowledging Venetian supremacy henceforth."
 ven_annex_cyprus_title: "Conquer Cyprus"
 ven_annex_cyprus_desc: "The Crusader state of Cyprus was propped up in part with aid from Venice, however the perfidious Lusignan dynasty proved themselves irresponsible and detrimental as allies, collaborators, and even as a subject. Cyprus with or without them will nonetheless suffer without the guiding hand of Venice to spare it from hardship. It is time to cash in on forgotten debts, and retake a most valuable investment."
 ven_greece_title: "Partition Greece"
 ven_greece_desc: "The Greeks were once worthy of respect, however their propensity for falling into civil war over the most petty disputes has taken its toll. The Byzantine Empire, once viewed as an at least semi-legitimate Roman successor, is now the worst joke ever told; a failed state compared to its neighbours and trade partners. The hubris so commonly punished in their own literature has clouded the Greeks, and it is to this end that the Venetians must put them in their place. Greece shall be cut down to size and then some."
 ven_thrace_title: "Avenge the Fourth Crusade"
 ven_thrace_desc: "The Fourth Crusade was ultimately the perfect time for Venice to strike at the terminus of trade into Europe, Constantinople, under the false pretense of ferrying forces headed to the Holy Land. Alas, the deceptions never fully paid off, as the stubborn Byzantines crushed the mercenary army and set the Venetian fleet alight following a lengthy blockade. This wound has cut deep enough to tarnish Venice's prestige and standing amongst other European realms; the gravest of insults, and one which must be avenged no matter how high the toll rises."
 ven_latin_title: "Latinokratia"
 ven_latin_desc: "Constantinople has been fully seized by our armies and the city is under our control. Now, we must decide its fate."

 ven_scuole_grandi_title: "Scuole Grandi"
 ven_scuole_grandi_desc: "The 'Great Schools' of Venice are a variety of fraternities and other social organizations for the laity. Although they started off primarily dedicated to charitable activities, over the ages their purposes have gradually expanded, and now many of them support such varied activities as music, the arts, and medicine. Patronizing these organizations would go a long way towards endearing ourselves to the well-to-do citizens who run and fill out the ranks of these institutions."
 ven_palace_title: "The Seat of the Government"
 ven_palace_desc: "The Doge's Palace has been built, renovated, and rebuilt many times over the centuries. A further expansion, more ornate than any other in our realm's history, would do much to bolster the standing of the office and our nation as a whole."
 ven_standardize_relazioni_title: "Standardize Relazioni"
 ven_standardize_relazioni_desc: "The 'Relazioni' are the reports our ambassadors send to the government, detailing the political, financial, and social state of the countries they serve in. These documents are essential for both our own diplomatic efforts and for maintaining the competitive advantage of our merchants abroad, but it is an increasingly common practice for copies of relazioni to be published and made available to anybody willing to pay a high price for them. This is a threat to our own diplomacy and security. We must crack down on these publications, and establish a common, secure system for the writing and dissemination of relazioni."
 ven_promote_the_carnevale_title: "Promote the Carnevale"
 ven_promote_the_carnevale_desc: "Our famous carnival dates back to 1162 and our magnificent victory over the Patriarch of Aquileia. Since then, the festivities have become even grander, the costumes more ornate, and the celebrations all the more decadent. Quite frankly, its magnificence is all out of proportion for what it's supposed to celebrate, but we can use that to our advantage. The more we expose foreign diplomats to the grandeur of Carnevale, the faster word of our opulence shall spread."
 ven_ducale_title: "Promissione Ducale"
 ven_ducale_desc: "The Promissione Ducale is the oath of office all candidates must swear by to become the new Doge of Venice. It outlines the duties of the Doge, and states the limits on the Doge's powers. Over the years, however, some of the checks have... waned, a little. If we were to draft a new primissione ducale, one that more firmly restates our values and the roles envisioned for the Doge, not only would our government be strengthened, but more virtuous candidates for office might step forward as well."
 ven_wars_title: "The Italian Wars"
 ven_wars_desc: "The Italian Peninsula has become a hotbed, nay, a powderkeg, in recent times. From invading Muslims to ambitious warlords, the stability of this region is likely to further spiral into oblivion. It would be prudent to take advantage of this age of conflict, because despite her destiny to rule the sea, Venice regardless benefits from continental commitments. Make it so."
 ven_ravenna_title: "Connect Ravenna"
 ven_ravenna_desc: "Ravenna, the former capital of the long-dissolved Western Roman Empire, proved to be one of Venice's greatest war-prizes against the Lombards. Alas, it is nonetheless isolated from the Republic's other continental holdings by land. This leaves it vulnerable to attack or rebellion if reinforcements don't come by ship soon enough - something which the Doge's military advisors haven't overlooked. It is time this crisis in the making sees itself preemptively rectified."
 ven_dominate_title: "Reign in the North"
 ven_dominate_desc: "Blessed with fertile farmland and serving as home to the most well-developed of the Italian cities, the north is nonetheless suffering. The rule of the Lombards has been nothing short of burdensome, in no small part due to their constant propensity for engaging in warfare. By consolidating Venetian rule in the north, a new era of prosperity can begin."
 ven_dock_title: "Expand the Dock"
 ven_dock_desc: "Venice's docks are truly a sight to behold; bustling with sailors and thriving from merchant traffic. Aside from gangpressing, staffing the navy stems primarily from recruiting at these maritime hubs. Of course, as the fleet expands, the need for fresh blood does too. By expanding these docks, the thalassocracy will no doubt be all the stronger for it."
 ven_flagship_title: "Launch a Flagship"
 ven_flagship_desc: "The Venetian fleet suffered catastrophic losses to Byzantine saboteurs while blockading Constantinople in 1204, with much of the fleet reduced to smouldering hulks just barely floating atop the water. Most shamefully, the Republic's flagship was destroyed, leaving the navy without a vessel to rally around. With the economy in a much better state than it was prior, the Doge has become deadset on launching a new flagship for his new navy."
 ven_admiralty_title: "Venetian Admiralty"
 ven_admiralty_desc: "The leadership of Venice's navy is often disunited, bickering amongst themselves like the petty nobles and fat traders they are. Without a doubt the most detrimental element of the Republic's army at this point, the creation of an admiralty board which can decide on maritime policy independently from the Great Council would be a great boon."
 ven_genoa_title: "Dominate Genoa"
 ven_genoa_desc: "The swindlers and charlatans of Genoa have been a thorn in the Most Serene Republic's side for many centuries. From cumbersome trade conflicts in the Levant to aiding the pirates of Sicily, the line has long since been crossed. It is high time that the Lion of Saint Mark asserts itself as the dominant trade power in the Mediterranean."
 ven_isles_title: "Seize the Isles"
 ven_isles_desc: "The isles are of critical importance to the Venetian military, and ambitions across the Mediterranean. By serving as naval outposts, which can act as springboards for future expansion, Venice will have the edge it needs to come out on top of the other powers vying for naval supremacy."
 ven_nostrum_title: "Mare Nostrum"
 ven_nostrum_desc: "The Most Serene Republic of Venice's future is one in which the thalassocracy reigns supreme across the Mediterranean. By ensuring the navy is completely unrivalled at sea and the armies are unbeatable on land, by consolidating the lands of Italy and beyond, Venice will be able to declare Mare Nostrum; the sea shall belong to the merchant republic and them alone."
 ven_roman_title: "The Roman Resolution"
 ven_roman_desc: "Rome, the beating heart of Italy, has seen much better days. Even still, it proves a most illustrious city with enough prestige contained within its walls to legitimise any upstart empire. Consequently, seizing Rome before anyone else - especially those damnable Sicilian pirates - appears to be the most sensible course of action. Vae Victis!"

 lat_osman_title: "Tolerate the Ottomans"
 lat_osman_desc: "Although Muslims have no place in our new empire, the Ottoman family is far too wealthy and influential to be banished from the city. Perhaps we should make an exception in their case, as cooperation with them could certainly benefit us."

Was it not you, great Lech, the One that went north, the One that saw the beautiful, yet fierce white eagle, closely guarding it's precious nest under the light of a setting sun?

On behalf of the Polish nation, we politely ask you to cease all such actions immediately.' the man was angry indeed. The advisors around the Pomeranian Duke snickered at the demand of the Pole. The Duke, in his calm and jokester nature, first told his advisors to quiet up and then answered the diplomat: 'Well, gentlemen, we wouldn't want to anger the Big Bad Poles now, do we?' A couple of seconds of silence, then the Duke looked around the room and continued: 'You are all simply shaking from the thought, right?' the snickering started again. 'The thought of getting subjugated by the Polish army of halfwits and dullards! Ha!' The entire room burst into laughter, they laughed and laughed, the duke said one last thing to the diplomat before he sent him away: 'Go home, son, stop embarassing yourself. Go on then! Go and tell your King of our response!' He smirked at the envoy before he was shown the door."

 pol_advance_title: "Invasion of Rus'"
 pol_advance_desc: "The land of one of Lech's brothers, Rus to be exact, has seen better days - ravaged by the Tatar Yoke, infighting and lack of consolidation and harsh winters.

 mva_pannonia_title: "Secure Pannonia" 
 mva_pannonia_desc: "The Pannonian Slavs serve as a cultural link between the West Slavs and Southern Slavs. With the ever menacing threat of the Magyars on their border, it is necessary for us to integrate them into our resurgent empire and allow us to reunite with our southern brethren."

 mva_wien_title: "Imperial Incursion" 
 mva_wien_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire has always eyed our lands with greed, and the Austrian threat to the west is becoming increasingly relevant with a massive military build up. By leading an expedition into lower Austria, we can create a buffer between our capital and the Germans." 
 mva_great_title: "Restore Great Moravia" 
 mva_great_desc: "Centuries ago, our great empire ruled over all the west Slavs, but invasions from the Magyars and Franks have reduced our once proud state to a mere rump state; but, after years of reconquest, we have rebuilt Great Moravia stronger than ever before. Parades shall be held across all our major cities to celebrate our rebirth as the new European great power. No Frank or Pagan will ever destroy our proud empire! " 
 mva_lusatia_title: "Recover Lusatia" 
 mva_lusatia_desc: "The Sorbians were once the extent of our empire, but their refusal to convert and unrelated issues with Magyars led to them declaring independence.

 mva_bohemia_desc: "The Bohemians have lost their way over the years, siding with the German invaders in the west instead of their Slavic brothers in the east.

 mva_bulgaria_title: "Push on to Bulgaria" 
 mva_bulgaria_desc: "The Bulgars have become the hegemon of the Balkans after the decline of the Roman Empire, and while they built up a powerful slavic empire, it is time that we take the mantle of the Unifier of the Slavs and seize control of Bulgaria directly.

 mva_tsar_desc: "The Roman Empire has been in a state of constant decline ever since the 6th century, internal strife, outside invasions, and a failed bureaucracy has resulted in the once mighty empire to collapse to a mere rump state centered around Constantiople.

 mva_preslav_title: "Center of the Slavic Culture"

 mva_fate_empire_title: "Fate of the Empire" 
 mva_fate_empire_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire once contributed to our decline, but without them, we would have fallen to the Magyar horde long ago.

 mva_sons_of_lech_title: "Subjugate the Sons of Lech" 
 mva_sons_of_lech_desc: "Centuries ago, two brothers known as Czech and Lech went their separate ways and settled their tribes away from each other.

 mva_mother_cities_title: "Mother of Cities" 
 mva_mother_cities_desc: "To the east, the lands of Kievan Rus’ have spread Russian culture northeastward. The origin point of this spread is the legendary city of Kiev, though the city has fallen into a sad state since the Mongol Hordes sacked it. We must expand the mother city of all of Rus’ to help legitimize our rule over the Ruthenians. Kiev will become a metropolis that will outshine all of the west." 
 mva_wendish_crusade_title: "Wendish Crusade" 
 mva_wendish_crusade_desc: "The Pagan Wendish are the furthest west the Slavs have ever settled, but their refusal to see the true faith makes them a target to their neighbors.

 mva_baltic_title: "Conquer the Baltics"

 mva_invade_rus_title: "Invade Rus'" 
 mva_invade_rus_desc: "Our brothers in blood to the east have been under constant attack from the Mongol and Tartar hordes from the steppe. By uniting them with our grand empire, we can finally claim the title of the Unifier of all Slavs, and with it, our hegemony over all of Eastern Europe.'"

Great Moravia will create an empire that will lead the Slavs into a new era." 
 mva_glagolitic_title: "Modernize the Glagolitic" 
 mva_glagolitic_desc: "The Glagolitic script was created by the brothers Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius in 863 to help spread the Orthodox faith in Moravia. While the use has changed over the years with conflict between Catholics and Orthodox, it still stands as the clerical script used in Moravia. By standardizing the script, we will eliminate any possibility of misinterpreting the holy scripture." 
 mva_zakon_title: "Zakon Sudnyi Liudem" 
 mva_zakon_desc: "The Court Law for the People is the oldest Slavic legal code, first copied from the Byzantine Ecloga law; it has spread throughout the Orthodox Slavic world as the main rule of law. But, it is severely outdated and needs updating. Thankfully, the printing press allows us to produce copies of the updated Zakon Sudnyi Liudem at a rapid rate and quickly spread them out throughout the land." 
 mva_universities_title: "Orthodox Colleges" 
 mva_universities_desc: "The most learned people in our empire are the Orthodox clergymen that administer the church. Funding new colleges to be constructed and operated by these men will allow for us to better educate our population while also ensuring that Orthodox teachings are ingrained into their minds." 
 mva_panslavism_title: "Embrace Pan-Slavism" 
 mva_panslavism_desc: "All Slavs originate from one ancestor, and while we may have gone our separate ways and established separate traditions from each other, we are all brothers in blood. No longer shall petty disputes and religious strain stop us from uniting and becoming the Slavic global hegemon!" 
 mva_canonize_title: "Canonize Rostislav" 
 mva_canonize_desc: "Rostislav remains one of the most important figures in Moravian history, the first ruler to overthrow Frankish hegemony and the first to bring the light of Orthodoxy to the realm. His legacy was tarnished after the betrayal of his own nephew who imprisoned and left Rostislav to die in a Frankish prison to satiate his own lust for power. By canonizing Rostislav as a martyr for the Orthodox cause, we can create a unifying figure among the Orthodox Slavic world." 
 mva_religious_reforms_title: "Religious Reforms" 
 mva_religious_reforms_desc: "The Orthodox Church of Moravia has always been threatened by the Papists in the west and Pagans surrounding us from the east. The people of Moravia need guidance in these trying times. Churches must be constructed across the lands and all priests must be convened to solidify Orthodox teaching across the realm." 
 mva_patriarchate_title: "Moravian Patriarchate" 
 mva_patriarchate_desc: "Moravia has always been on the edge of the Orthodox world, cut off from the rest of it by the pagan Magyars; we relied more on local traditions instead of those in Greece. To ensure that we are in better communion with Constantinople, a Patriarchate shall be established to administer all of Great Moravia and settle all local religious disputes." 
 mva_seat_title: "The Royal Seat" 
 mva_seat_desc: "The center of the Moravia realm is the city of Veligrad, and while its grandeur has fallen off a bit since our golden age, it still has plenty of room to grow. By expanding districts, constructing monuments to legendary Slavic figures, investing into local businesses, establishing a functional sewage system, we can create a city to rival all of westerndom!" 
 mva_kremnica_title: "Golden Kremnica" 
 mva_kremnica_desc: "The gold mines of Kremnica have barely reached their peak potential, and we are missing out on a serious source of income. Mines must be expanded of course, but constructing a mint will allow us to mine the gold and mint out coinage at the same time. The wealth generated from this will of course go to the army, but maybe we could afford to siphon some of it to the average citizen." 
 mva_nitrava_title: "Fortress Nitrava" 
 mva_nitrava_desc: "The duchy of Nitrava has been our border state with the rotten Magyars for over 400 years, and we need to ensure they cannot reach the capital of Veligrad. The fortress of Nitrava needs to be expanded to create an impregnable fort that no army can ever take."

 mva_cities_title: "Cities of Moravia" 
 mva_cities_desc: "Times are changing, and the Agrarian lifestyle of our forefathers has become more and more obsolete. The west has already seen multiple great urban cities spread across the land, and urbanization has barely reached the east. By compensating farmers and expanding previous cities, we can create a series of grand cities across the empire." 
 mva_industrialize_title: "Industrialize Moravia"
 mva_industrialize_desc: "The discovery of the steam engine and the beginning of industrialization has seen the entire world shift.

 smi_reconquer_title: "Reconquer Kainuu"
 smi_reconquer_desc: "The Sami people have inhabited the lands of northern Scandinavia for thousands of years. However, our way of life as nomadic reindeer herders does not work with modern borders used by other nations, since lands used by herders for centuries may look like an uninhabited wasteland to most outsiders. This why the lands like that of Kainuu, which is mostly inhabited by Sami people that practice their religion, is claimed by a foreign power who will seek to erase their culture to make way for their own. We need to reconquer this land and liberate our people from their foreign masters. With this first step, we will traverse the road to reclaiming the lands of the Sami people and safeguard our way of living."
 smi_laponia_title: "Unite Laponia"
 smi_laponia_desc: "The lands of Laponia are the most scarcely populated in all of Europe. Yet greedy kings still claim these lands for themselves. Only we have a deep enough history and the cultural ties to truly understand and utilize the true value of its frozen beauty. This final reconquest will finally unite the Sami people under one ruler, guaranteeing the way of life that our people have followed for thousands of years."
 smi_finland_title: "Conquer Finland"
 smi_finland_desc: "The Finnish and the Sami people have always had much in common. We practice the same religion, our languages are very similar and most importantly, we are both surrounded by foreign enemies that wish to destroy us and our culture. To prevent this from happening, the Finnish and Sami people need to unite into a single realm whether the Finns want to or not. This action may bring the Finns to despise us like any other foreign conquerer, but in the future, we will be remembered as the men that secured independence for the Finno-Ugric people."
 smi_capital_title: "Develop the Capital"
 smi_capital_desc: "The city of Aerviesjaevrie is much smaller than other capitals in Europe, consisting of only a few permanent settlements including the chief's private residence. Diverting a large number of resources into developing our capital will greatly benefit us administrative, economically, and militarily. A larger capital will also give us the benefit of projecting our power abroad, showing our warmongering neighbors of Sweden and Norway that we are the rulers of the far north and not a people they can simply conquer."
 smi_trade_desc: "Wealth is the lifeblood of kingdoms and trade is the most profitable source of wealth. During our many interactions with our southern neighbors, the most peaceful once have been during the trade of reindeer furs, something we have in large supply. The only problem with our fur trade is the market that is available to us. Due to our geographical location, the Baltic sea is our only source of maritime trade, with the White sea being frozen over most of the year and its coast being scarcely populated. To increase the wealth of our realm, we need to expand our trade influence in the baltic sea, by whatever means necessary."

Normandy has a long history of Scandinavian raids and colonisations. The name itself comes from the Latin word Nortmanni which means 'men of the North'. Utilizing the same strategy we used when we conquered the British Isles, we will conquer Normandy to have a stable position for attacking the rest of Europe. It has been ages since we properly raided the french, I wonder what sort of treasures the emperor keeps in Paris?"
 nor_ulster_title: "Invade Ireland"
 nor_ulster_desc: "The island of Ireland consists of multiple kingdoms and earldoms which constantly fight and undermine each other. The only reason these tumultuous lands haven't been conquered is due to the island rather remote location to the rest of Europe. If any foreign power wishes to conquer Ireland they need a big navy and an ambition to conquer even the most remote locations. Luckily for us, we fit both descriptions. To begin our conquest we need to secure the northern coast close to our holdings in the Isles. From there we can later expand into Ireland proper."

 nor_baltic_desc: "With Scandinavia finally being united into a single realm, we must now look to expand our power to the rest of the Baltic sea.

The Baltics are also a great first step in our greater conflict against the multiple Slavic kingdoms to our East and South."

 nor_scania_desc: "Denmark may be a religious ally in our war against the Swedish crusaders, but there will come a time when there no longer is an enemy to unify us. It's then that the true conflict for Scandinavia will begin and we must be prepared for it. Our first step in subjugating our brothers is to seize Scania, Denmark's only territory on the Scandinavian peninsula. Taking it from the Danish will leave them trapped on their islands, where they will be completely at our mercy."
 nor_denmark_title: "Conquer Denmark"
 nor_denmark_desc: "The final conflict against our Danish brothers has begun. The capital of the Danes, Kobenhavn, is the largest port and sound toll in the baltic sea.

 nor_eastcoast_title: "Colonize East Coast"
 nor_eastcoast_desc: "The history of Norway has always consisted of the quest for greener pastures. It's the reason our ancestors took to the sea to raid others, it's the reason we went to war with English kings and it's the reason we decided to sail into the unknown to find the legendary Vinland. Now we have found it and it's even better than the legends promised. Explorers report that to the south of what our ancestors named Vinland lies large sways of green land that is mostly unpopulated. If we were to send strong men and their families to colonize these fresh lands we could feed the entirety of Norway several times over. We also need to send some soldiers with them, to make sure that the inhabitants of this land don't interfere with our settlers."

However, the Frankish domain has recently been in decline, much like the time when Otto the Great seized the crown.

 hab_lotharingia_desc: "Otto I saw the Kingdom of Lotharingia separated from Francia, and the Holy Roman Empire, in the middle of a Carolingian succession crisis long ago. Since then, it has remained a small area independent from, but surrounded by, the Empire. An insult to the Emperor and all his proud subjects, the lands of Middle Francia ruled by that rogue, unrecognised state must once again be reintegrated into the Holy Roman Empire."
 hab_ostend_title: "The Ostend Company"

 ned_wallonia_desc: "Wallonia is not a region that has had particular importance for us in the past, being French speaking and culturally different from our main territories. However, it is a rich land, with wealthy cities and a large population: it would be a fantastic addition to our nation."
 ned_united_title: "The United Netherlands"
 ned_united_desc: "If all of the Low Countries can be brought under our rule, a unique Netherlandish identity can be developed. Not solely Dutch, French, or German, the United Netherlands will be a beacon of prosperity and unity in Europe."
 ned_calais_title: "Port of Calais"
 ned_calais_desc: "The port city of Calais is located in a strategic location for trade with England and the wider world. Goods from as far away as North Africa and Russia arrive at its shores, and thus represents a trade hub of a size unmatched in Western Europe. We must secure it, for the glory and good of the Koninklijke Marine!"
 ned_drain_title: "Drain the Wetlands"
 ned_drain_desc: "The fenland and marshes of the Netherland do not suit themselves to prolonged economic development on such a large scale. We must construct levees and dikes to stabilise the rivers, and undergo a great project to remove water from the floodplains: only then will the true riches of the Netherlands be shown to the world."
 ned_canals_title: "The Canal System"
 ned_canals_desc: "Our cities have grown significantly over the past decades, and the current infrastructure is struggling to accommodate the new populace. A system mostly relying on the construction of canals connecting the Zuiderzee to various rivers has been devised to allow for further expansion: following this route will lead to great affluence in our lands."
 ned_capital_title: "Expand the Capital"
 ned_capital_desc: "Our great capital [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] requires growth in order to sustain our rapidly expanding nation. We must expand infrastructure and develop a planned city to serve as a thriving hub for our conquests."
 ned_expand_title: "Economic Development"
 ned_expand_desc: "The Netherlands are not a large nation, especially compared to our rivals in the west or across the Channel. To compensate for this diminutive size, we must heavily invest in creating a prosperous nation with a booming economy, as to remain competitive with possible foes."
 ned_textile_title: "Textile Industry"
 ned_textile_desc: "Raw wool from England and Spain makes its way to our shores, where it is then processed and made into cloth. Our clothmakers have been renowned for their skill and expertise for centuries, and thus this trade has potential to become a major source of income to the state, if it is capitalised upon."
 ned_diamonds_title: "The Diamond Capital"
 ned_diamonds_desc: "In the past few decades, Amsterdam has grown into a significant gemstone working hub, mostly due to immigrating Jews arriving into our lands seeking shelter. This diamond cutting business is largely unrecognised in the rest of Europe, despite the profit it brings: by encouraging its production and incentivising new workers to take up the profession, Amsterdam may yet become known across the world as the City of Diamonds."
 ned_garrison_title: "Fixed Garrisons"
 ned_garrison_desc: "The garrisons in our cities are oftentimes neglected and reduced in size during peacetime, only to be hastily restaffed in times of conflict. This leads to unfortunate circumstances where garrisons cannot be replenished in time, with possibly disastrous consequences. Let us institute a system of permanent garrisons, and make our nation into an impenetrable wall."
 ned_amsterdam_title: "Port of Amsterdam"
 ned_amsterdam_desc: "The great Port of Amsterdam has grown into a trading location of considerable size in the past centuries. Despite this fact, there are still areas that have more trade volume than Amsterdam does, reflecting negatively on our income: the Port must be expanded, and our trades in Europe must grow ever larger."
 ned_college_title: "Admiralty Colleges"
 ned_college_desc: "A professional navy requires professional leaders. We need a regulated system of training and promotion to ensure that excellent seamen can become excellent captains, and excellent captains can become excellent admirals."
 ned_beggars_title: "Sea Beggars"
 ned_beggars_desc: "Watergeuzen, known as Sea Beggars in English, are powerful and determined privateers that are skilled at blockading cities. Having them on our side will help bolster our navy and give us an extra edge over our opponents."
 ned_city_council_title: "Strengthen the City Councils"
 ned_city_council_desc: "The City Councils in the Netherlands are often weak and inefficient at doing their jobs, said jobs being administration and taxation of our cities. We must strengthen their permissions and their abilities to maximise the production and power found in our small nation."
 ned_generality_title: "Generality Lands"
 ned_generality_desc: "It is important to administer our country fairly, never favoring one province over another too much. To that end, the central government sometimes needs to directly administer lands to prevent one regional faction from gaining too much influence in national affairs."
 ned_reformation_title: "Answer the Reformation"
 ned_reformation_desc: "The Reformation has swept across Europe like a scythe through grain, and religious conflict has sparked throughout the continent. We must either accept or renounce the Reformation: one way or another, we cannot remain neutral in this time of troubles."
 ned_stadt_title: "Merge the Stadtholders"
 ned_stadt_desc: "Nominally, every province within the Netherlands has a Stadtholder, who holds executive power over their domain. In practice, however, a stadtholder rules many provinces, and several have ruled a majority of provinces in the Republic, where the bureaucratic system adds inefficiency. We must merge the stadtholders of the provinces into one office, a Stadtholder-General."
 ned_contract_title: "Regent's Contracts"
 ned_contract_desc: "The regents are a particular class of provincial patricians, the leaders of city councils and the wise men who fill the ranks of national committees. Among themselves, there are flashes of partisanship, driven by dynastic ambitions, personal grievances, and rarely some genuine ideological differences. Since these people are our chief administrators and responsible for the governance of our cities, it is in the government's interest to lessen the tensions between regents. One of the more straightforward solutions is to encourage contracts between regents, where they agree to alternate control of a political office between them. That way, even if one family doesn't like another family in power, they know that their turn in power will come soon if they just wait."
 ned_general_reglement_title: "Issue General Reglement"
 ned_general_reglement_desc: "The myriad provincial laws of our lands provide countless opportunities for abuse and corruption. General laws which apply consistently to every province in the land may conflict with the traditional rights of the states, but they will go a long way towards providing efficient and honest government for all our people."
 ned_je_maintiendrai_title: "Je Maintiendrai"

 ned_ivory_title: "Reach West Africa"
 ned_ivory_desc: "Ivory is one of the most prized goods in Europe, brought from distant West Africa to our shores. We must send an expedition out at once to gain information on these rich kingdoms, and perhaps establish trading posts along the way."
 ned_exploration_title: "Colonial Ambition"
 ned_exploration_desc: "The Dutch have always been natural seafarers owing to their position on the North Sea. Let us venture forth into the great unknown, and create settlements to spread our influence."
 ned_channel_title: "Secure the Channel"
 ned_channel_desc: "The English Channel is one of the wealthiest and busiest waterways on Earth. Unfortunately, much of the trade and subsequent income do not end up in our ports, and instead seek to buy and sell elsewhere. This must change if we are to grow into a genuine European power."
 ned_caribbean_title: "Explore the Caribbean"
 ned_caribbean_desc: "The Caribbean could be an excellent place to set up colonies - we just need to know what's there, first."
 ned_cape_title: "Reach the Cape"
 ned_cape_desc: "The Cape of Good Hope was first reached by Portuguese navigators in the late 15th century. We must outfit our own expedition, and map the southern tip of Africa with accuracy."
 ned_west_indies_title: "Dutch West Indies"
 ned_west_indies_desc: "The East Indies aren't the only source of fabulous riches abroad. There's more money to be made in the Transatlantic trades, which we could have if only the government was willing to support a few key merchants..."
 ned_north_america_title: "Colonize North America" 
 ned_north_america_desc: "The Americas produce many lucrative goods which we would be foolish to ignore. It's vital that we establish a presence in the north, where we could perhaps engage in the beaver fur trade and seek some sort of accommodation with the natives."
 ned_york_title: "Nieuw Amsterdam"
 ned_york_desc: "The Americas produce many lucrative goods which we would be foolish to ignore. It is vital that we establish a presence in the north, where we could perhaps engage in the beaver fur trade and seek some sort of accommodation with the natives."
 ned_brazil_title: "Base in the South"
 ned_brazil_desc: "Brazil is a land of wealth and wonder, full of exotic woods and ripe for agriculture. It would be wise for us to colonize these lands, or take them if someone made the mistake of colonizing lands we are interested in."
 ned_capetown_title: "Found Kaapstad"
 ned_capetown_desc: "The Cape of Good Hope is an important waypoint on the route to the East Indies. Establishing a station there and offering a safe harbor for our ships in the midst of the long voyage east is a prudent choice."
 ned_austrlaia_discover_title: "Nieuw Zeeland"
 ned_austrlaia_discover_desc: "Our contacts in the Indies speak of a land to their south, full of strange creatures like giant rats with pouches, and a beaver with the beak of a duck. Even if the lands aren't rich in resources, this is something we have to see for ourselves."
 ned_indies_title: "Dutch East Indies"
 ned_indies_desc: "Our trade in the Indies flourishes, but the security of our commerce and our merchants is in jeopardy as long as our economic control of the region isn't matched by political control. For the continued prosperity of the region and our national interests, it is imperative that we bring as much of the Indies as we can under our control."
 ned_take_malacca_title: "Conquer Malacca"
 ned_take_malacca_desc: "Malacca is an important town in the East Indies, one which we must not tolerate falling into the hands of our competitors. It must be taken!"
 ned_dutch_formosa_title: "Dutch Formosa"
 ned_dutch_formosa_desc: "To better intercept our competitors' trade in the Far East, and to help our own merchants trade with China and Japan, we should establish a base on the island of Formosa."
 ned_japan_title: "Japanese Handelsposten"
 ned_japan_desc: "There are several small islands in Japan around the major trading port of Nagasaki. Japanese authorities are not keen on having us establishing a major presence everywhere in Japan, but if we were able to gain a foothold in a single island, that alone would be enough for us to break into Japanese trade networks."
 ned_charter_voc_title: "Charter the East Indies"
 ned_charter_voc_desc: "Consortiums of merchants such as the Heren XVII are keen to expand their portfolios and invest in overseas trade. If we supported the establishment of some sort of East India Company, the profits could be immense!"
 ned_conquer_ceylon_title: "Seize Ceylon"
 ned_conquer_ceylon_desc: "The rich island of Ceylon is not only a lucrative source of income itself, but also a key waypoint for ships sailing further east. If we do not seize it, our enemies surely will."

 norway_heathen_title: "The Great Heathen Army"
 norway_heathen_desc: "The Great Heathen Army of yore was a Dane-lead coalition that invaded England. It was the largest organized effort by the vikings ever committed and had the most lasting impact, especially in British Isles as our Danish cousins successfully conquered the Four English Kingdoms. The Danes, however, have disappointed the vikings. They failed to upkeep their conquests in England and the Great Heathen Army has stopped existing, forever to be left in the pages of history as a shameful failure. The Danes have shown their weakness, being defeated by the peace-loving Christ-loving weaklings...\n\n But that does not mean that the time of Viking is over.\nBang the drums,\nBlow the horns,\nRouse the pillagers.\n The Great Heathen Army will be brought back under Norwegian rule, stronger than ever before with a clear purpose - War."
 norway_berserkir_title: "Berserkir"
 norway_berserkir_desc: "The Great Heathen Army's conquests in England have brought rise to many rumors that helped create the scarring image of a Viking Warrior that struck fear in the hearts of many while their hearts were unphased by bleeding - Berserkir. The Berserkir tradition is a powerful one in Viking culture, one we have not really utilized too well as only key few strangers utilzied it. Perhaps it would be a smart decision to utilize the Berserkirs and create a proper strikeforce of them that shall be attached to our armies with the purpose of shocking our foes."
 norway_stamford_title: "Revenge for Stamford"
 norway_stamford_desc: "1066 was a year of misery. The Dark Legend of Stamford tells a story about a viking king from the north named Harald Hardrada who was given the claim to the Kingdom of England. Though Harald was accursed by Christendom he still lived his life like a viking. He was Norway's first chance at staking its claim at Conquest of England reminiscient of Danes' own and bring back the Danelaw. The accursed bridge of Stamford, however, deemed him unworthy as the Norwegian forces were pushed back... \n\n But 400 years have passed, and with it times has changed. The salted wounds have been licked clean and locked shut. It was time for revenge. It was time to avenge the shameful defeat. It was time to conquer England afresh."
 norway_dragon_title: "Behead the Dragon"

 norway_northern_desc: "We have finally found our peer - the Scottish. They are some of the most ferocious fighters we have an honor to know, as every fight with them is a fight of honor. However, due to their close proximity we need to take them down and defeat them utterly. We will take their lives and their freedom."
 norway_albion_title: "Rule Albion"
 norway_albion_desc: "The Isles are a natural extend of Norway. They are a landmass separated from Europe with a natural barrier of ocean, much like how Norway is a landmass separated from Europe with a natural barrier of Scandes. The Christened yoke of south will find it hard to invade both the isles and Norway on sea and impossible on foot. If we can assert dominance over all of Albion we may usher in a new Viking Age - a New Danelaw - over Albion."
 norway_high_king_title: "High King of Ireland"
 norway_high_king_desc: "There lies a land much like Iceland to the west of Albion - Ireland. It is devoid of wood, and of natural resources. Still, leaving a Christened realm so close to our foreskin would be unwise, especially when the Irish claim for a title more prestigious than ours. Certainly fame and glory awaits from the utter battling with the Irish."
 norway_normandy_title: "Conquer Normandy"
 norway_normandy_desc: "The Fate of the Normans is to submit under their forebearers' rule. Normans are failed vikings that embraced partially the French ways and lost their courage and competence. They are vikings that have taken the role of servants. Let us turn then into exactly that - vikings' servants."
 norway_paris_title: "Raid on Paris"
 norway_paris_desc: "Paris is on our doorsteps. We already rule supreme over the northern coast of France. The stories tell us of the splendor and wealth that Paris has to offer. Perhaps we ought to pay it a visit and see if the stories are true about the current center of Europe."
 nor_nse_title: "The North Sea Empire"
 nor_nse_desc: "We have managed to reclaim a grand stake of Europe that we once held sway over in the glorious 800s, but that is not enough. We need to reclaim everything that the viking forebearers of ours used to rule over. The times of yore are returning, with the Norwegians being the sole people capable of bringing them back. The North Sea is a Viking Sea and only Vikings should rule it."
 nor_dismantle_hansa_title: "Dismantle Hansa"

They dare think that they are safe from viking raids. Their hubris will be their downfall. We shall raid the cities of Hansa and take the wealth for ourselves."
 norway_novgorod_title: "Control Novgorod"
 norway_novgorod_desc: "The legends tell of Rurik who rowed onward to the bog-filled darkened woods of Rus. One by one the northern tribes fell to him and his descendants' conquests, with only greatness sung about those who fell in the mighty battles. The viking rule in Russia was shortlived, however, as similarly one by one his descendants fell to the corruptive influence of Slavic faith and culture. As if that was not enough the Slavs and slavified Descendants of Mighty Rurik fell to the seduction of Christendom, never to see Valhalla.\n\nThe times have changed. The Vikings are making a comeback, with a breath of fresh air blown to our lungs, and with it we have a renewed thrill towards achieving glorious battle. Russia is a land of glorious combat - combat that we much indulge in. Novgorod was the city of Rurik and it must be returned to the Viking hands."
 norway_crimea_title: "Grip over Crimea"
 norway_crimea_desc: "As we push southward we bear witness to an area that is reminiscient of Norway - geographically beautiful and amazing base for raidings. Its located in a well defendable Peninsula, and has fine port locations where we can build the grandest raiding port. As if that was not all the Black sea's shore is filled with so many rich villages, specially Miklagard.\nWe will violate the Black Sea with axes and torches and leave its shores desolate from our base in Crimea. The ashen villages shall dot the coastline, with all of their wealths pushed to the hands of glorious vikings."
 norway_rurik_title: "Legacy of Rurik"
 norway_rurik_desc: "We are the first vikings that Rurik can be proud of, for we have returned a piece of Russia under Viking rule, unlike his descendants that are all now petty slavic princes. \n Our invasion, however, is not yet complete. The select few descendants of Rurik that were slavified were able to hold to viking tradition and conquer large swathes of land, eventually forming the Kievan Rus. One could argue that, if we are to uphold the legacy of Rurik, we need to conquer all of Kievan Rus and a bit more. Glory awaits those who are ready to surpass Rurik and his descendants."
 norway_miklagard_title: "Claim Miklagard"

The nation ruling over the city has fallen into disrepair and desolation, but the city still holds glory to it. The city has never been successfully sieged by anyone. Arabs, Persians, and even us the Vikings failed to take the city. We should make history by becoming the first people to successfully take over the only real city in all of Europe."

In recent times, however, material has surfaced for new sagas. Glorious battles, thrilling adventures, and prestigious raids are but a few of the new materials we have. We should record these events into creating new sagas fitting for the second age of vikings."
 nor_longships_title: "Construct the Longships"

They turned us into boogieman, but we are offended by the fact that their depiction of the number of ships is wrong. We should craft a fleet fitting for the stories the christians have fabricatedabout us so we may strike more accurately fear into their hearts."
 nor_north_sea_title: "Control the North Sea"
 nor_north_sea_desc: "The North Sea is a viking sea. It was so back in 800s and it shall be again. The Christians have no place here in the barren wastelands and cold waves of the north. The trade that flows into the North Sea shall be made submissive to the viking traders."
 nor_bergen_title: "Bergen Entrepot"

It is hard to live here, and there exists a few among our vikings that wish to conquer lands for the sake of more enjoyable climates. We should indulge in our fellow vikings' desires: We should look for warmth that escapes our homes."
 norway_princes_title: "Rein in the Princes"
 norway_princes_desc: "The Slavic Princes shall be conquered and broken to fit a more viking mold. They are brave warriors, which could mean that they can be turned into proper servants under the Vikings - maybe even equals.

 vlt_fortify_title: "Fortify Barlin"
 vlt_fortify_desc: "The city of Barlin has thanks to our efforts to become something truly worthy of admiration. Yet it's beauty brings up a great concern among us, what were we to do if the city were to fall to enemies who seek the plunder and devastate it. To preserve the dignity of our capital and protect the High Priest from harm we must make sure that no enemy can enter its streets. We will construct great fortifications along the borders of the city, something that will require large expenditures but will greatly benefit us in the future."
 vlt_capital_title: "Develop the Capital"
 vlt_capital_desc: "The City of Barlin has been the center of our realm ever since the Holy Principality was properly established in the City. Unfortunately, the City does not reflect the importance it plays, lacking much-needed development and infrastructure that a modern capital needs. The greatness of an empire reflects in the greatness of its capital and if we are to claim the title of a Wendish Empire, we must ensure that our capital is capable of housing the vast amount of people that will need to visit the city and make sure that our architecture properly reflects the greatness of our empire. With our help, Barlin will go from a marshy woodland to the greatest city in Northern Europe, able to challenge the likes of Paris and Prague."
 vlt_expand_title: "Expand the Union"
 vlt_expand_desc: "While the lands we control are not horrible compared to other regions of Europe, they are still not sufficient for our current plans. If we are to form an Empire for ourselves we must make sure that our people can support it. If we wish to fund our future empire and hope to keep up with the rest of Europe then the High Priest and the Holy Principality must divert vast resources to developing the union into a stronger economic power."
 vlt_army_title: "Raise an Army"
 vlt_army_desc: "The possibility of a Germanic invasion has always been in the back of our and our citizen's minds, knowing that defeat could mean the end of Veleti as we know it. That is why it's completely unacceptable that our army is in the current state it is. The Holy army is severely understaffed and is in dire need of greater funding. If we are to defend our home and conquer new lands in the name of the Gods we must make sure our army is capable of posing a threat to anyone who seeks to oppose us."
 vlt_obotrites_title: "Subjugate the Obotrites"
 vlt_obotrites_desc: "Although the Obotrites are Wendish like us, they remain subjects under their power-hungry duke who rather helps himself than doing what is best for the Wends and the Slavic faith. If we continue to let us be divided by petty rulers then the Germans will have no problem conquering our people. If we wish to form a great Wendish Empire we must first ensure Wends are united in our common goal of creating a united Empire where we can truly prosper."
 vlt_hansa_title: "Cripple Hansa"
 vlt_hansa_desc: "The trade ports of Lubeck and Hamburg are by far some of the largest centers of trade in Europe and are the headquarters of the Hanseatic League, a German trade company that controls much of the trade in the Baltic sea. The League has for a long time doing their best in excluding us from profiting from the trade in the Baltics and use much of their money to fund future invasions into Wendia. No longer do we have to tolerate this unacceptable treatment of our merchants and the time has come for us to seize these valuable cities for our gain."
 vlt_polans_title: "Invade Poland"
 vlt_polans_desc: "The Kingdom of Poland was once the greatest empire of the Eastern Slavic world, with lands that included multiple peoples such as the Pomeranians, the Sorbs, the Moravians, the Slovaks, and even some eastern Slavs. Now, only various petty kingdoms remain, fighting amongst each other for survival. If the Poles can't protect their people, then we have no choice but to intervene ourselves. The time of a Polish empire has long passed, it's time we take their place as the great empire of the East Slavic world."
 vlt_wendish_title: "The Wendish Empire"
 vlt_wendish_desc: "With the Wendish people united under the benevolent rule of the Holy Principality, we must now seek to expand our realm to our remaining northern Slavic brothers. While the Pomeranians and the Sorbians might not at first understand their place in the Wendish Empire. But soon everyone will see, that when the Northern Slavs unite against the common Germanic threat, we can achieve true greatness and become a modern European Empire."
 vlt_silesia_title: "Conquer Silesia"
 vlt_silesia_desc: "Our Silesian brothers to the south may not be close to any German kingdom, instead, they are threatened by something far worse. The Kingdom of Bohemia may be Slavs like us, but they chose to betray their brothers in favor of joining the German monstrosity that is known as the Holy Roman Empire. We need to quickly establish control over the lands inhabited by the Silesians to protect our fellow Slavs, even if it is against other Slavs."
 vlt_trade_title: "Control Home Trade"
 vlt_trade_desc: "Managing a realm able to unite the Slavs of Europe and crushing the Germanic invaders requires a strong economy. A large part of our economy derives from the trade that transpires on the river of Spree. While trade is profitable, we are still at the mercy of German and Bohemian traders who can direct trade away or simply ignore us to weaken our economy. To challenge this stranglehold we must challenge these traders by seizing their markets for ourselves and putting them under embargoes of our own. If we are to improve our economic standing in the future we must ensure that we cannot be economically bullied into submission by sly and corrupt traders."
 vlt_baltic_title: "Baltic Ambition"
 vlt_baltic_desc: "The Baltic sea is one of the most profitable areas in Europe thanks to the extensive trade that transpires between Scandinavia and their southern neighbors. As Wendia is located on the southern coast of the Baltic sea, we greatly benefit from trading the valuable metals of Scandinavia in exchange for more southern luxuries that are rare in the cold North. Buy securing more influence in the Baltic trade, we would be able to gain even more wealth to strengthen our realm."

 yua_china_naval_silk_road_desc: "Silk has always been the most profitable export from China, especially to european merchants. For ages untold, the harsh land route through central Asia and Persia was the premier way to transport silk and other goods to Europe from China. With our control over sea routes and grand navy, we can create a safer and more navigable silk road over the ocean."
 yua_china_unknown_desc: "The land that Europeans call 'the New World', has been discovered to be more easily reachable by us than previously known. Should we create settlements in this mysterious land, perhaps we could beat the Europeans at their own game."
 yua_rival_europe_desc: "While European nations, with their colonies and squabbles, love to refer to themselves as the 'great powers of the world', they live in ignorance of the true Power, the middle kingdom. Perhaps it is time to outdo them once and for all, even if it means engaging in their petty rivalry games."

 id_coalition_desc: "We need allies if we are to have any chance of defeating the false Shogun in the East. With as many enemies as they have, it shouldn't be difficult to spearhead a coalition against them."
 id_warring_title: "The Warring Clans" 
 id_warring_desc: "Western Japan has suffered division and infighting for far too long. We must gather what forces we can, and unify the clans under a single banner."
 id_supremacy_title: "Win Political Supremacy" 
 id_supremacy_desc: "The political landscape among the so-called independent daimyo is volatile and ready to spill out into open war at any moment. If we are to truly remove the false Shogun and unify Japan, achieving political supremacy in the home region is imperative."
 id_dethrone_title: "Dethrone the Usurpers" 
 id_dethrone_desc: "We have finally gathered enough strength to march upon the enemy capital itself. No longer shall the Emperor be a puppet to the false Shoguns; a mere subject to a dying, foreign empire. Nor shall Japan suffer such humiliation again!"
 id_north_title: "Rein in the North" 
 id_north_desc: "The time has for us to control the often-neglected north of Japan. Resistance from the rugged and uncooperative warlords may make conquest difficult, but we must bear the blows lest Japan remain disunited."
 id_south_title: "The Southern Campaign"
 id_south_desc: "Having secured most of Honshu, it is now time to push onwards to Chugoku, Kyushu, and Honshu. The south shall be ours, now and forever more!"
 id_unite_title: "Unite Japan"
 id_unite_desc: "We must do more than simply drive out this new Shogun of Karasuma. Aye, we shall surpass even the Kamakura regime of old, and rule Japan as its undisputed master!"
 id_naval_title: "Found the Navy"
 id_naval_desc: "It was our lack of a strong navy which led to this period of humiliation and subjugation. We must now commence the construction of a true Japanese Navy, so that none may threaten our isles again."
 id_protect_title: "Maritime Trade Protection" 
 id_protect_desc: "As we gain more access to the sea, we secure the trade that comes along with it. Alas, pirates go hand in hand with such lucrative maritime commerce, often preying upon our fledgling merchant flotillas. We shall endeavour to crush any and all piracy, smuggling, and all other forms of banditry which threaten our economy."
 id_balance_the_four_divisions_title: "Balance the Four Divisions" 
 id_balance_the_four_divisions_desc: "The chaos which engulfed Japan until recently has greatly disrupted the social harmony of our state, causing numerous breaches to the caste system and damaging centuries of work to establish harmony! The situation must be rectified immediately, and we know just the way to re-establish order."
 id_rival_title: "Eclipse the Shogun's Fleet" 
 id_rival_desc: "The Shogun has amassed a naval force which holds the potential to threaten our own, evidently a challenge to our righteous cause. Lest our own fleet finds itself reduced to burning hulks off the coast, with Shogunate forces laying siege to our coastal bastions, we must rapidly expand our forces until the Shogun is eclipsed in all theatres."
 id_develop_title: "Expand the Capital" 
 id_develop_desc: "The capital is the most important part of any realm, especially so for one as small as ours. In order to make the most of it, we would do well to invest in all facets of its development and infrastructure, allowing our state to truly flourish."
 id_fortify_title: "Fortify [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 id_fortify_desc: "Our capital is the most obvious target for an invading force, and so we must defend it at all costs. [Root.Capital.GetName] shall be re-fortified until her walls are deemed impregnable to cannonfire; unscalable for even the hardiest troops!" 
 #MongolDaimyos
 dai_shogun_title: "Appease the Shogun"
 dai_shogun_desc: "Even though the Shogun is weak, the other daimyos are still loyal to him and are ready to fight anyone who might challenge him. Until the tide turns, we should kneel before him for protection."
 dai_dethrone_title: "The Fate of Kyoto"
 dai_dethrone_desc: "In these troubled times, the Shogun has proven incapable of maintaining stability, destroying the free clans and protecting the emperor. For they are weak, the time has come for us to take the city of Kyoto and the title of Shogun for ourselves."
 dai_north_title: "Defeat the Free Clans"
 dai_north_desc: "When the Mongols invaded Japan and claimed Kyoto, the country was divided in two. While the South naturally recognised the authority of the new Shogun as prescribed by the ancestral laws, the Daimyos of the North refused to pledge allegiance and declared their independence. Now that the emperor has given us the title of Shogun, it is our duty to bring the free clans back into the path of our authority."
 dai_unite_title: "Unite Japan"
 dai_unite_desc: "Any remaining Daimyos who have yet not submitted to our authority must be brought to heel immediately. Only under a united Japan can we hope to expand beyond the home islands."
 dai_supremacy_title: "Win Political Supremacy"
 dai_supremacy_desc: "Our aspirations are greater than any mere Daimyo’s. It is our duty, our destiny to reach the highest levels of power in the land."
 dai_warring_title: "The Warring States"
 dai_warring_desc: "Far from being a united country, Japan is divided into many independent lordships engaged in endless war. If we want to survive and defeat our neighbours, we must build an army of our best ashigaru and samurai."
 dai_south_title: "Rein in the South"
 dai_south_desc: "The Southern Daimyos are those who have accepted the Shogun's authority. They are our closest neighbours and will certainly accept our rule over their lands, even if our army might be needed to convince them."
 dai_balance_the_four_divisions_title: "Balance the Four Divisions"
 dai_balance_the_four_divisions_desc: "Society is divided into four parts, which need to be in perfect balance to create a truly harmonious society. This period of ours is sadly one of gekokujo, where even the lowest can overcome the highest in society. We must find a way to remedy this grievous ill and restore harmony."
 dai_naval_title: "Construct a Fleet"
 dai_naval_desc: "As part of an island, we are very dependent on our ships both for moving our army and for trade. For this reason, we need to build a fleet that can challenge our neighbours."
 dai_protect_title: "Protect the Naval Trade"
 dai_protect_desc: "As part of an island, we are very dependent on our ships both for moving our army and for trade. For this reason, we need to build a fleet that can challenge our neighbours."
 dai_fortify_title: "Fortify [Root.Capital.GetName]"

 dai_develop_title: "Expand the Capital"
 dai_develop_desc: "Our capital is the heart of our economic activity and the symbol of our power. We should develop it to shine more brightly than any of our neighbours."
 dai_rival_title: "Naval Superiority"
 dai_rival_desc: "Two centuries ago, the Mongol armies of Kublai Khan invaded Japan and defeated the Shogun. Since that day, we are well aware of the importance of maintaining a powerful navy. Therefore, we must build the largest fleet in Japan, for the sake of [Root.GetName]!"
 #Toyouji
 tjj_reign_title: "Rein in the Clans"
 tjj_reign_desc: "For almost one hundred years, the Yuan have been in turmoil, and with it, any chance to call upon imperial aid. We are now left to our own devices to safeguard our dynasty’s interests in Japan. We must rein in the clans which gained too much autonomy, and who seek to advance their own power."
 tjj_integrate_title: "Integrate the Daimyo"
 tjj_integrate_desc: "The Daimyo have long been acting independently from our rule. This is a shameful display, and completely unacceptable. We must ensure that they follow our laws, and focus on developing their lands, rather than tearing each other apart over territorial scraps."
 tjj_envoy_title: "An Envoy to Khanbaliq"
 tjj_envoy_desc: "The Yuan dynasty still holds the capital of Khanbaliq, and while we may be perfectly fine on our own, we ought to despatch an envoy to our continental brethren. By updating them on the political situation in Japan, we can assure the court that we are still loyal to the empire."
 tjj_ronin_title: "Banish the Ronin"
 tjj_ronin_desc: "The Ronin have long been a source of lawlessness in Japan; these masterless samurai roam the land with allegiance to nobody but themselves. We need to banish the Ronin, thus promoting stability in a Japan free of war."
 tjj_balance_the_four_divisions_title: "Balance the Four Divisions"
 tjj_balance_the_four_divisions_desc: "These last decades of disorder have seen many people rise above their station, and eventually challenge us. In order to better administer the land, steps must be taken to ensure that people are kept to their professions."
 tjj_naval_title: "Construct a Fleet"
 tjj_naval_desc: "Before the Mongol invasion, Japan was already a local naval power, even though some of them were pirates. With our increasingly independent efforts to rule in Japan, we should construct a new fleet. This will ensure our dominance in the regional seas, increased profits in maritime trade, and prestige amongst the various divisions of the Empire."
 tjj_protect_title: "Protect the Naval Trade"
 tjj_protect_desc: "Naval trade is an important source of income for us, and with our recent efforts in fleet construction, we can protect our maritime trade more effectively. However, we must endeavour to further make sure that no privateers dare threaten us, and so our traders will continue to ensure Japanese interests in regional trade centers."
 tjj_ghost_title: "The Ghost of Tsushima"
 tjj_ghost_desc: "Tsushima was one of the first places the first waves of the Mongol invasion struck in their conquest of Japan. We encountered heavy resistance from the clans there, and even to this day, some remaining guerilla fighters are still resisting our rule. We must construct forts, and improve local infrastructure, to increase the effectiveness of the pro-shogunate militia and deal with the guerilla fighters."
 tjj_palace_title: "Renovate the Heian Palace"
 tjj_palace_desc: "The Heian Palace is a symbol of our legitimacy as the ruling shoguns of Japan. It ensures that the people see the land and Emperor as thriving, even if true authority is found within our residence at Karasuma Castle. With additional funding from our coffers, we should seek to renovate Heian Palace as a renewed symbol of legitimacy, and unity."
 tjj_fortify_title: "Fortify Kyoto"
 tjj_fortify_desc: "Kyoto is one of the most important political centers of Japan, being the residence of the Emperor of Japan base of operations for the Shogun. In the event of enemy incursions, we must ensure that Kyoto does not fall, for if she does, the rest of Japan is dragged down too. Therefore, we must launch extensive efforts in fortifying Kyoto as the bastion of Shogunate rule."
 tjj_tradition_title: "Mongol Army Traditions"
 tjj_tradition_desc: "Despite ruling over Japan for over a century, we cannot forget our Mongol roots. Deep down the ruling class is still Mongol, and the traditions of our forefathers flow through our blood. The ways of the Mongol army proved to be effective before, its doctrines securing Japan for us, and so we should promote and safeguard its sacred traditions. There will be a time where it shall come to our aid once more."
 tjj_unite_title: "Unite Japan"
 tjj_unite_desc: "In name alone has Japan has been united under an Emperor; in reality, most of its lands are controlled by local feudal lords known as daimyo. With our reformed administration, and professional army, we must see to the true unification of Japan."
 tjj_army_title: "Raise an Army"
 tjj_army_desc: "Despite the fact that Japan is an island archipelago, and a strong naval force would protect us, we must still raise and maintain army, should an enemy break through our naval blockade, and made landfall. Even if we don’t encounter hostiles abroad, however, a strong security force is still an intimidating sight for dissidents and criminals."
 tjj_north_title: "Subjugate the Eastern Clans"
 tjj_north_desc: "There are certain parts of Eastern Japan never touched by the Mongols, for a multitude of reasons, and unfortunately limiting the Shogun’s rule in some areas. The loyalty of the regional clans was always quite dubious, at times bordering on treason! As such, we mustn’t tolerate their increased disobedience towards the Shogun; the time has come for us to mount an expedition, subjugate the eastern clans, and bring order to the region – once and for all!"
 tjj_expand_north_title: "The Northern Campaign"
 tjj_expand_north_desc: "Although the Mongol invasion was successful, it ultimately failed to bring all of Japan under the authority of the Mongol Shogun. The clans in the north still refuse to bend the knee and accept our authority. Our previous rulers have attempted to resolve this situation by negotiations, but it brought very little success. We shall not repeat their mistakes; Japan will be united under our rule, one way or another!"
#Shogunate
 tjj_korean_invasion_title: "Control Korea"
 tjj_korean_invasion_desc: "Korea was once dominated by the Mongols under the Goryeo state, an arrangement which lasted for a century and a half in relative peace. During the Red Turban Rebellion, however, rule of Korea slipped out of Yuan's grasp and has remained so ever since. We must subjugate the Koreans once more - this time under us, instead of the [YUA.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 tjj_throne_title: "The Dragon Throne"
 tjj_throne_desc: "The Mandate of Heaven is a core concept in Chinese governance, where kings and emperors may only rule with the favour of the divine. If they are unjust and weak, they shall lose the Mandate, and face divine retribution for their actions. As the Yuan dynasty has grown weak, and many doubt Heaven's contentment with their ruler, it would be only natural for another to take the mantle. Ideally us."
 tjj_beijing_title: "Capture Khanbaliq"
 tjj_beijing_desc: "Khanbaliq, known as Youzhou to the Chinese or Zhongdu to the Jurchens, is the imperial capital and political heart of the Yuan. If our ambitions to dominate Asia are to be fulfilled, we must seize Khanbaliq!"
 tjj_nchina_title: "The Middle Kingdom"
 tjj_nchina_desc: "With our stronghold in China secured, we must now advance into the historical centre of Chinese civilisation: the north. Made rich and prosperous by the Yellow River, owning the north will bring us great wealth, while also eradicating our former Yuan overlords, so no one may threaten our dominion over Asia." 
 tjj_warlords_title: "Control the Warlords"
 tjj_warlords_desc: "China below the Yellow River is in a state of constant flux, suffering from rampant warlordism and fighting. Thusfar, no side has truly managed to defeat another, before being defeated and replaced by another rising power. These warlords, no better than bandit-kings, are weak and disunited; it shall be easy to manipulate and subjugate as we please."
 tjj_subjects_title: "Subjugate the Chinese"
 tjj_subjects_desc: "The Southern Chinese warlords are unruly, and would make a direct occupation of the south untenable. Therefore, we must subjugate them under a vassal relationship to gain the wealth of China, without the troubles that conquest brings. They shall be eased into accepting our rule, in time."
 tjj_turtle_ships_title: "Adopt the Turtle Ships"
 tjj_turtle_ships_desc: "During our invasion of Korea, we were forced to face their Turtle Ships, or Geobukseon, which granted their coastal fleet an undeniable combat advantage. We must embrace their ship design and improve upon it, so that we may never again risk defeat at sea."
 tjj_zaibatsu_title: "Found the Zaibatsu"
 tjj_zaibatsu_desc: "As our economy continues to grow, the merchant class has inevitably found itself in a position of wealth and power. Although officially at the bottom of the caste system, it is hard to look down on ones so adept at seeking and creating wealth. We must actively support them, and found mercantile conglomerates, or 'Zaibatsu', to help our economy prosper."
 tjj_construct_the_gokaido_title: "Construct the Gokaido"
 tjj_construct_the_gokaido_desc: "Although our domestic opponents have been subdued, it is important that we continue to keep these lords in check. Building a new system of roads and waystations would help make the daimyo domains easier to reach from the capital and barracks, boosting local commerce along those routes in the process."
 tjj_permit_ryogaesho_title: "Permit Ryogaesho"
 tjj_permit_ryogaesho_desc: "Many daimyo have suffered from erratic finances, causing some to default on loans they foolishly took in moments of desperation. Enabling smaller money change shops to offer more reliable loans, and to back up those loans with our own reserves, should help stabilise daimyo finances. As an added bonus, this may perhaps foster a healthier domestic economy."
 tjj_issue_new_erizeni_rei_title: "Issue New Erizeni-Rei"
 tjj_issue_new_erizeni_rei_desc: "Sound finances are the bedrock of stable government. To ensure that order is maintained and trade continues, we shall encourage a steady flow of good coinage into the realm by issuing the erizeni-rei: a conversion between low to high quality coins."
 tjj_five_routes_title: "Improve the Gokaido"
 tjj_five_routes_desc: "The Gokaido roads and stations have heavily increased our troops' speed across Japan, but there is still much to be done. If we are to make the Gokaido into a true unifying pathway, connecting all parts of our domain, it is vital to maintain and overhaul the pathways to account for increased usage by horsedrawn vehicles. This will ensure that we can easily and quickly respond to any threat to us from overseas, with the added benefit of being able to crush any revolts within our lands without giving them time to organise."
 tjj_survey_the_secret_fields_title: "Prevent Secret Fields"
 tjj_survey_the_secret_fields_desc: "It is embarrassingly common in the provinces for farmers to maintain so-called 'secret fields'; farmland hidden from the eyes of tax collectors. A thorough accounting of these unreported properties should significantly bolster our coffers."
 tjj_argiculture_title: "Agricultural Overhaul"
 tjj_argiculture_desc: "Our agricultural practices have remained static for millennia. Today's farmer tends to their rice fields in the same manner as their father, as did their grandfather, going back to the reign of the first emperor. These methods have served us well, but we cannot let ourselves fall behind. We must modernise our agricultural practices to accomodate for a changing world."
 tjj_manchuria_title: "Invade Manchuria"
 tjj_manchuria_desc: "The wild tribal lands of Manchuria hold great potential, provided that we can secure it and civilise their inhabitants. We must establish a foothold there."
 tjj_okinawa_title: "Claim Okinawa"
 tjj_okinawa_desc: "Okinawa, under the Ryukyu Kingdom, has served as a key trading port in Oriental commerce for some time. To truly take control of eastern trade, Ryukyu must be brought under our rule!"
 tjj_ogasawara_title: "Settle Ogasawara"
 tjj_ogasawara_desc: "The Ogasawara, or Bonin, Islands are located far south of the Japanese mainland, uninhabited by humans. Despite hostile terrain, with some development they could be a fantastic springboard into the great unknown sea in the East."
 tjj_taiwan_title: "Colonise Formosa"
 tjj_taiwan_desc: "In order to stand strong, we must expand our empire further. A prime location for conquest is the island of Formosa, uncolonised and ripe for economic development."
 tjj_moluccas_title: "Control the Moluccas"
 tjj_moluccas_desc: "The Moluccas consist of thousands of little islands, most having grown wealthy from the spice trade. Many of these islands bear little in the way of civilisation, thus potential resistance, making them a prime target for our first colonies in the south."
 tjj_indonesia_title: "Invade Indonesia"
 tjj_indonesia_desc: "Our dominion cannot be confined to the Moluccas alone - we must extend our reach even further, so as to profit from the lucrative trading hub of Indonesia."
 tjj_pacific_title: "Pacific Rim"
 tjj_pacific_desc: "As our reach grows, so too does our need for defense. While we look to the west for opportunities, we must also take heed of the vast ocean expanse to our east. Who knows what threats may come from there? It would be prudent to assert our power over the Polynesian islands, thus securing our empire's heartland from foreign attack."
 tjj_new_world_title: "Sunrise Invasion"
 tjj_new_world_desc: "Beyond the sea lies a New World, full of opportunity. Some even whisper of a kingdom wealthy beyond measure; a golden state ripe for the picking. We should establish bases in these mysterious lands, claiming this land for Japan in the name of Emperor and profit!"#Tocharia
 tcr_forces_title: "Muster the Forces"
 tcr_forces_desc: "With enemies all around us in the form of the Khitans, Oirats, Tibetans, and of course the Mongols, we must prepare for any threat that could find itself at our border. Marshall the troops, fortify the garrisons, and rally the bannermen. We shall defend our territory to the last man!"
 tcr_war_title: "The Three Kingdoms"
 tcr_war_desc: "Ever since the collapse of the Chagatai Khanate, the Tarim Basin has been home to the three major Tocharian Kingdoms; Shule, Kuci, and Kroriana. Each has been ravaged and ruined by the various empires that have pushed into the Basin from the Han to the Mongols. Each one continues to vie for power against the others, often sending raiding parties and small excursions to test the might of their rivals. However, now is the time to end this conflict and to finally see which Kingdom shall rule over the basin." 
 tcr_unite_title: "Unite Tocharia"
 tcr_unite_desc: "For over 200 Years, the Tocharian Empire remained a fractured and broken mess. With the other tribes under our heel, we can now begin to project our power outwards towards to both old and new foes alike, to reclaim the lands once lost."
 tcr_khitan_title: "End Khitan Opression"
 tcr_khitan_desc: "While the Khitan were instrumental in the Chagatai Revolt that brought us out of the Mongol’s Shadow, they have since proved as tyrannical as the hordes before them. Demanding tribute and forcing their influence over our kingdoms, trying to keep the basin weak and fractured. Now that we are a united force, we can push back against Qara Khitan, repaying them for each blow they dealt to us."
 tcr_oirat_title: "Invade the Oirats"
 tcr_oirat_desc: "The Oirats lay between us and the Great Yuan. As a military force, the Oirat could be a powerhouse should they be united. Their lands are filled with strong warriors and soldiers, all ready and willing to ride out into battle; we must ensure this never comes to pass and move to secure the region for ourselves."
 tcr_rival_title: "Rival the Great Yuan"
 tcr_rival_desc: "While the Yuan ruled as masters of the East, unparalleled in strength and power, they are but a fraction of the threat they once were to our state. With rebels and rivalling factions, the cracks in their great empire begin to show, ones which we must abuse if we are to put down the aging empire."
 tcr_mongolia_title: "Tame the Mongols"
 tcr_mongolia_desc: "In the past, when the Kuci had refused to submit to the Mongol Empire, they sent their armies to burn our settlements and reduce our civilization to rubble. Our people have not forgotten, nor have they forgiven. We shall ride into their territory and ensure they shall never be a threat to us anymore."
 tcr_guard_title: "The Western Trade Route"
 tcr_guard_desc: "The trade routes that stretch from Baghdad to Beijing are dominated by various tribes and hordes that raise their taxes and tariffs on the goods that flow on the silk road. They grow fat from this trade, filling their coffers and palaces with riches beyond belief. Should we remove them, we can take the trade for our own, dominating the silk road once more."
 tcr_steppe_title: "Into the Steppes"
 tcr_steppe_desc: "To our west, the vast untamed steppe remains a daunting expanse. Nomadic tribes, Khanates, and other foes lie just to the horizon. We must secure this land for our own and settle the vast plains with the Tocharian people."
 tcr_tibet_title: "Control Tibet"
 tcr_tibet_desc: "In the past, the Tibetan Empire had attempted to dominate the Basin, but were stopped by our brave soldiers. In the millennia since, they have remained fractured and broken. At this pivotal moment, we shall push through and take the region for ourselves."
 tcr_kashmir_title: "Secure Kashmir"
 tcr_kashmir_desc: "The riches of Kashmir, once guarded by strong empires, now lays open for the taking. Silk, spice, wool and cotton all find themselves in this mountain range, and we shall seize it for ourselves."
 tcr_khorasan_title: "Legacy of the Kushans"
 tcr_khorasan_desc: "The Kushan Empire was, at one point, an empire that aided ours in our hour of need against the Han Dynasty. In the modern day, the land of the Kushan lays bare of their history, with few remnants of their might and power. We will honor their legacy and bring their territory into the fold, as a thank you to our ally long gone."
 tcr_persepolis_title: "March on Persepolis"
 tcr_persepolis_desc: "The ancient city of Persepolis lies just to our west. With a push, we could use the province as a forward operating base for other incursions into the region."
 tcr_persia_title: "King of Kings, Ruler of Rulers"
 tcr_persia_desc: "The mighty Sassanians have fallen so far since their golden era of ages gone past. We shall march to their cities and claim the title of ruler of Iran for ourselves and maintain our dominance over the region for all of time to come!"
 tcr_silk_title: "Terminus of the Silk Road"
 tcr_silk_desc: "We have reached the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. In the south, the lands of Egypt prove fertile and bountiful as always, while to the north, trade from the ancient city of Antioch continues to flow down into Italian ports. Here, on the sandy beaches of this great sea, we shall continue subjugate kingdoms and empire alike as we have done the world over; We shall bring all of the silk road, from China to Europe, into our realm!"
 tcr_nchina_title: "Bane of the Khagan"

 tcr_nepal_desc: "Nepal is a strange border for our kingdom; the mountain range prevents movement between our Indian and Tibetan holdings save for a few key passes, and yet, if we do not secure these passes, we shall be left in a position where enemies could sneak through and attack our kingdoms. The mountains cannot hold the border alone; we must send troops to secure the passes and maintain the security of our realm."
 tcr_bengal_title: "The Bengal Campaign"

This bloody event, and the threat of future attacks to our people, was a major factor in the rebellion against the Chagatai. Many rulers now claim that they shall be the ones to rebuild our empire into what it once was, and many point to Kuci as the place they shall start with. While many rulers have promised to rebuild the city to its former glory, few have succeeded.

 tcr_tax_title: "Tax the Merchant Caste"

 tcr_levy_desc: "Our armies rely on Levies from local lords and elites. However, this leads to us being increasingly reliant on nobles who have ulterior motives and often traitorous goals.

 tcr_faith_title: "Secure the Faith"

Expand the once wartime decree into something that controls accepted cultural and lifestyle conventions."

 gor_mongol_title: "Mongol Intervention"
 gor_mongol_desc: "The Mongols are incapable of keeping themselves propped up as the masters of the Orient, and so it falls to us - their former subjects - to intervene and clean up the mess left behind. They could at least show some gratitude when we establish order, the Goryeo way."
 gor_north_china_title: "Unite North China"
 gor_north_china_desc: "After the fall of the imperial capital, it is only natural to expand further. Its previous occupants clearly seek to reclaim it, by any means necessary.

 gor_development_desc: "Our peasantry make the enormous majority of our people. It would be very foolish of us to anger them, or we can risk revolts where peasantry refuse to work the fields and our country faces famine.

 gor_gukjagam_desc: "The Gukjagam is one of the most elite institutions within our kingdom, and has served as a cornerstone of Confucian reform for centuries. As with all things, however, it has grown complacent and in many ways obsolete. Its prohibitive cost is certainly a key contributor to this, as student numbers have been steadily dropping since the Joseon Rebellion began. We must reform and restructure the Gukjagam if it is to survive into the modern age."
 gor_achieve_juche_title: "Achieve Self Reliance"
 gor_achieve_juche_desc: "Economic self-sufficiency is a goal any nation must aspire to, if it wishes to be truly independent from the shackles of others.

 jsn_pacific_desc: "Taiwan was a success. It proves us that the business of colonialism might be plausible as not only a source of prestige but also of profitability.

 jsn_new_world_title: "Reach the New World"

We shall complete the modernization of our army."
 japan_firearms_title: "Introduce the Firearms"
 japan_firearms_desc: "What beautiful wonders do the merchants bring to our shores? Firearms. They are simply beautiful in their simple streamlined design and their destructive force.

 japan_turtle_ships_title: "Integrate the Koreans"
 japan_turtle_ships_desc: "Conquerors ought to embrace the best aspects of their new subjects. Although many believe that our culture is superior to the Korean one, it would probably be wiser to treat them as our equals, so that we may utilize their institutions and inventions."
 japan_beijing_title: "Capture Khanbaliq"
 japan_beijing_desc: "Khanbaliq - the city of world's desires - is under Yuan control. We do not forget how the mongols succeeded in invading our island. We should work towards achieving retribution and punish the Mongols for what they did to us. We should start this by the conquest of Beijing."
 japan_throne_title: "The Dragon Throne"
 japan_throne_desc: "The Mandate of Heaven is a tempting concept. Though we were never possessors of one and for most of history it was solely a Chinese title the recent Yuan dynasty opens possibility for foreigners to claim it for themselves. If we claim the mandate for ourselves we can certify our position over the Chinese as their overlords. It would be a fitting poetic end to our relationship with Chinese: For long the Chinese considered us as inferior beings, and now they are made subservient to us as we achieve the highest rank any chinese could think of."

 japan_invade_indochina_desc: "The smoke from our Chinese conquests rise to the sky and its smokes carry our pride and glory to new heights. The smoke spreads outside of China, however, and needs more fuel to continue existing. Our nation is already great, but it can be so much more. It can be made into something unnaturally great if we keep our glorious victories going. Our next target should be Indochina. Its citizens ought to be able to be submitted to the rule of the Chrysanthemum Throne."
 japan_burma_title: "Burmese Intervention"
 japan_burma_desc: "Burma holds much wealth to it, even if it is far away from our homeland and sustaining our evergrowing borders becomes harder with each conquest. With the conquest of Burma the final frontier opens: India. If we can conquer Burma then we can ensure that we can sustain our empire through wealths gained from recently conquered lands."
 japan_thailand_title: "Conquer Siam"
 japan_thailand_desc: "Siam is in a beautiful location due to its importance to trade. People wanting to trade with us will have two routes: Through Malaysian toll hell or through Siam.

 japan_khmer_title: "The Dark Age of Cambodia"
 japan_khmer_desc: "As we venture deeper into Indochina we come to find many beautiful cities - most recent of them being abandoned by the recent dark age of Khmer empire.

 japan_okinawa_title: "Control Ryukyu"
 japan_okinawa_desc: "Okinawa is a pesky little daimyo off mainland Japan. It has paid lipservice to Japan, but was never truly subservient to it and was instead left to its own makings. We should fix this issue and finally make it fall into fold with homeland."
 japan_institution_title: "The Colonial Institution"
 japan_institution_desc: "Japan is a mountaineous land. This normally would mean that population growth potentials would be limited but we managed to surpass expectations. In fact this expectaiton surpassment has been an issue for us, as the mainland islands are becoming extremely crowded recently. We need to create the institution of colonial affairs so we can mitigate the growing lack of housing by using rewards and force to make sizable amounts of our population migrate to our colonial possessions. This also helps homogenize our colonies to be closer to homeland, thus helping kill local diversities deemed dangerous."
 japan_ogasawara_title: "Settle Ogasawara"
 japan_ogasawara_desc: "To the south of us are a set of peculiar islands. Ogasawara islands are not too profitable on first glance, but on a second glance one can see that it serves as potential supply chain, allowing for our exploration and colonization ships to travel further down the pacific.

 japan_new_world_title: "Claim the New World"
 japan_new_world_desc: "The expansive ocean lies east of us. As far as our eyes can see there is only ocean. However, our previous attempts at exploring the ocean helped us discover occasional islands. Though they are few many of our explorers have a gut feeling that small isles and islands are not the only thing in the ocean with many swearing there lies something in the east. With our success at exploration and colonization thus far we ought to indulge in our curiousity once more."

We will force the foreigners to interact with our outrageous prices if they wish to taste these wonders. Politics, economy or war, whichever is more efficient, shall help us in achieving the ultimate hegemony."
 japan_south_title: "Charter the Southern Seas"
 japan_south_desc: "There is something further south - a landmass that's devoid of lush forests apart from keyfew spots due to how unwelcoming the climate and fauna are. It could serve as a suitable location to deport dissenters in our homelands - as far away from homeland as possible."
 japan_five_routes_title: "The Five Routes"
 japan_five_routes_desc: "Gokaido are our routes of great travel. They extend out from the city of Edo that's a center of sorts for these roads. With the wars that were fought on Japanese soil between the Mongol Shogunate and the Independent Daimyos the routes fell into partial disrepair due to the routes being split between the two forces. We ought to repair the routes and bring them back to their former luster."

 japan_christianity_title: "The Spread of Christianity"
 japan_christianity_desc: "'Jesus Christ was 21 years old when he came to Japan...' or that is how the Christians living in Shingo-mura like to tell the story of how Christianity came to the land. The true records of Christianity's arrival tell that it came to us first through merchants and later through missionaries. It remains a small scale faith, but due to its nature it is still rather disruptive to our orderly society. And yet, its coming provides us with an abnormal proposition: Convertion for diplomatic purposes. We could find ourselves perceived more as peers by the Europeans - maybe even possibly be capable to form alliances of immense ranges and come to become part of European affairs. The head of the Christian faith - The Pope - is after all a very powerful human that may look favorably to our convertion that he may look favorably upon us and look disfavorably at other europeans that do not accept us on diplomatic table. Whatever the decision is it is up to the only one who can decide for us: The Emperor. What will he decide: Old Traditional Ways or New Religious Faith?"
 japan_zaibatsu_title: "Found the Zaibatsu"
 japan_zaibatsu_desc: "The concept of a Zaibatsu is that of a large family-owned businesses holding grand mercantile empires within our lands. Through centralizing our economy around keyfey major companies we can have our economy run by companies that can afford investing huge amounts of their own profits back into their industries and won't need much outside help at sustaining themselves. Our economy shall be self-sufficient, with the Zaibatsus eternally indebted to us for creating them."
 japan_urban_title: "Urbanization of Japan"
 japan_urban_desc: "As times change so does Japan.

Cities are turning into the true source of power and revenue for the state - a source we ought to support in growing."
 japan_restoration_title: "The Imperial Restoration"
 japan_restoration_desc: "Foreign concepts flow into our nation - ideas that allure the Emperor along with his loyalists. Absolutism and its concept are tied heavily with the idea that the Monarch has divine right given from God to rule over the said nation. While we do not believe in the same faith as the inventors of the said concept in Europe it is still very compatible with our state, for our emperor is the son of the Sun Goddess and thus has divine right to rule over us. In true absolutist fashion we ought to expand his power so he may properly exercise his divine right to rule."
 japan_rising_title: "The Rising Sun"
 japan_rising_desc: "Japan is the land of Rising Sun - both in its meaning and in reality. And this reality shall be true in two fashions: Both in the symbolism of how when foreigners look over to Japan it is where the sun comes to them and in symbolism of how Japan itself is a Rising Sun - ever growing and ever flourishing. We will ascent to new heights as we will carry the shining beauty of the sun upon our shoulders and make our enemies jealous and our subservients humble."
 japan_education_title: "Reform the Education"
 japan_education_desc: "Our nation, if it is going to be on par with the Chinese, Mongolians or even the White Barbarians we ought to increase the literacy rates. If we are going to surpass others we need to be smarter than them.

 japan_capital_new_title: "A New Capital"
 japan_capital_new_desc: "For centuries, Kyoto was our capital city, the symbol of the emperor and the Shogunate. However, now that the Shogunate has been disbanded and the emperor has regained his power, it seems that a new era is beginning for our country. To mark the occasion, some propose that we move our capital to a different city which would become the new imperial capital of Japan."
 japan_palace_title: "The Imperial Palace"
 japan_palace_desc: "Until very recently, the emperor lived in the Kyoto-gosho, the Imperial Palace. Now that we have moved our capital, it makes sense that a new palace should be built for the emperor, right on top of the ashes of the old Shogun castle."
 japan_home_trade_title: "Control the Home Trade"
 japan_home_trade_desc: "Amongst the recent changes in our country is the opening up of Japan to the outside world, especially in terms of trade and foreign investment.

 japan_protect_pirates_title: "Protect Against the Pirates"
 japan_protect_pirates_desc: "For centuries, pirates have been a scourge for our country. Not only do the wakô plunder our coastline, but they act as a real deterrent to foreign traders, resulting in the isolation of our island. Now that we have ended the Sakoku period and are determined to open up Japan, we must destroy these pirates for good."
 japan_kaigun_title: "Teikoku Kaigun"
 japan_kaigun_desc: "Now that we are a true empire, we deserve a navy to match. We must build the most modern ships and recruit the best sailors we can find in order to be taken seriously by our rivals. By officially creating the Teikoku Kaigun, the Imperial Navy, we would show the world that we are entering the ranks of the great powers."
 japan_naval_capacity_title: "Increase the Naval Capacity"
 japan_naval_capacity_desc: "Our navy may have been vastly improved over the last few decades, but it is still not enough for our empire. We need to be able to build and repair our ships quicklier, to train our sailors faster, to expand our maritime sphere of influence. Only then will we deserve to be considered the best navy in the world."

 nll_temugid_desc: "The Temugids have been a constant threat to the clans of the northeast for over a century. Now that we have conquered the other tribes in the region, we must naturally bring our wrath upon them and rid our people of Mongol influence for good!"
 nll_wangiyyan_title: "Defeat Wanggiyan"
 nll_wangiyyan_desc: "The Wanggiyan clan, just like Aisin Gioro, is distantly connected to ours, yet they lack our tenacity and strength in warfare. We must conquer our cousins, and unite the Jurchen tribes under their rightful rulers: the Nara Ula!"
 nll_aisin_title: "Conquer Aisin Gioro" 
 nll_aisin_desc: "Aisin Gioro is a cadet branch of the Wanggiyan, and therefore is tied to our great Nara Ula clan dynastically. They have often shown their ambitions of uniting the clans of the northeast, yet cannot act on it as of now: we must strike before they do, and eradicate this threat."

 yua_nest_naval_silk_road_desc: "Silk has always been the most profitable export from China, especially to european merchants. For ages untold, the harsh land route through central Asia and Persia was the premier way to transport silk and other goods to Europe from China. With our control over sea routes and grand navy, we can create a safer and more navigable silk road over the ocean."

Perhaps it is time to outdo them once and for all, even if it means engaging in their petty rivalry games."

 mch_great_wall_garrison_desc: "Though it was once used to try and keep both the Mongols, and us, out of China, it obviously failed to serve its purpose effectively.

China must never fall to outside threats again."

 mch_study_desc: "The far away nations of Europe have started driving us out of our own sphere of influence as of late. Their eagerness to explore, combined with an insatiable desire for profit and overseas connections, may prove useful as a means of leverage.

 tgu_kham_title: "Conquer Kham"
 tgu_kham_desc: "Our settlement in Jianqiang was a precarious one. Our forefathers, escaping the bloodshed of the Mongol invasions of the north, had to fight to survive in this new hostile land, but not with swords or spears, but through words and cunning. They managed relations, leveraged favors, and traded securities to make our dynasty dominant in the settlement and gathered a small army to our side. With the Red Turban Rebellion throwing off the Yuan from the region, we were surrounded on all sides by far more powerful warlords, and yet, we found weakness in the disorganized Kham region. We have already swayed many of their monasteries to our side; we must strike while the iron is hot and secure the region for our own!"

 tgu_nirvana_title: "The Path to Nirvana"
 tgu_nirvana_desc: "With our conquests, we have come into contact with many different faiths.

 tgu_legacy_title: "The Tangut Retribution"
 tgu_legacy_desc: "Genghis Khan’s people rode into our lands, setting fire to our cities, killing our people, all in an attempt to eradicate us.

 tgu_skies_desc: "Our great emperor has pushed forward and taken countless provinces and cities, that was once owned by the proud and mighty Mongols. We now walk in the halls that the once the Song and Jin used to rule from, both failing in their attempts to conquer our great state. The only one to ever be able to defeat us, the Mongol, have been felled. Kingdom of the Great Xia of the White and Lofty Mother now rules as emperors supreme, and all of China shall be our domain!" 
 tgu_hunan_title: "Push into Hunan"

 tgu_production_title: "Agricultural Production"
 tgu_production_desc: "The Tibetan agricultural sector has been declining in the years since the collapse of the Sakya institution. Each year, crop yields are lesser and lesser, and monasteries are forced to pay less and less tax to their secular lords as they simply have nothing more to give. Under a united and watchful eye, we could be able to expand the crop growth and turn many of the downtrodden peoples in Tibet to be loyal subjects of the Tangut."
 tgu_income_title: "Wealth and Riches Untold"

We were a dominate force that even the mighty Han and Mongol respect; now, we have barely a handful of cities under our control, and few of the common people even speak our tongue.

 tgu_tradition_title: "Military Tradition"
 tgu_tradition_desc: "Our military, with the mighty Iron Hawks and Trekkers, once defeated the Song invaders and held back the Mongols for as long as they could.

 tgu_cannon_title: "The Cannon of Xia"

 tgu_shining_desc: "Tangut art always captured the fascination of those who viewed it, drawing from both Chinese and Tibetan styles. Often religious, the art would portray heavenly figures and bodhisattvas passing their knowledge down to us and were painted in murals and in caves.

 tgu_capital_title: "Reconstruct the Capital"

 tib_tanguts_desc: "Our conquest of the southern Kham territories and the Tangut peoples present us with an opportunity.

 tib_bonpo_desc: "Bon, in this age, is still somewhat practiced, and if anything, has seen something of a revival since the fall of the Tibetan Empire. While they are a minority religion within our Kingdom, it would be wise to utilize their talents to our advantage.

 amdo_priests_desc: "The monks within our state are a powerful political entity. In fact, we draw as much of our legitimacy from them as we do our mighty army. As such, we have to court them and maintain positive relations with them. If we should fail in this effort, we could collapse into ourselves rapidly, and lose what little territory we own."
 amdo_nestorian_title: "The Nestorian Expansion"
 amdo_nestorian_desc: "The Nestorians have invaded the Tocharian territories to the west of us.

 amdo_tangut_desc: "The Tangut people remain to the south even after we conquered their homeland, with the successors to Xi Xia still holding on under the banner of Li. We must stomp out this state, lest they come to challenge us for control over the region."
 amdo_fortify_title: "Fortify Amdo"
 amdo_fortify_desc: "Amdo exists in a precarious situation – the Oirat to the north, the Yuan to the east, and the warring tribes of Kham to the south. We must protect our realm with the construction and maintenance of a fortress within our territory."

 amdo_economy_title: "Improve the Economy"
 amdo_economy_desc: "Tibet is a poor society, materially. Their wealth comes from either simple subsistence farming or from the riches their monasteries gain in donation. Trade, while somewhat prominent, is limited. We know that the Tibetan people are strong and rich spiritually, so we must bring them the prosperity they deserve by building up infrastructure and economic growth in their land."
 #Temugids
 tmg_legacy_title: "Legacy of Temüge"
 tmg_legacy_desc: "Our Clan's origins come from Genghis Khan's brother - Temüge. In childhood and adolescence he was spoiled somewhat by mother and older brothers, but did not show signs of softening despite the spoilage. He was a courageous man - a powerful man that was quick in battle. As per Mongol tradition he was the child to inherit his and Genghis' father's belongings. Although Genghis saw him as shiftless, he was a capable ruler who ruled the Heartland in brothers' absence quite competently. Though not the youngest child of Genghis he was ambitious to claim the throne of Mongol Empire when Ögedei Khan died and his son was fighting in Russia. His seizure attempt was thwarted by Ögedei's widow. When Güyük was elected as Great Khan our founder was executed. Shameful end for our founder. As centuries have come to pass we festered in the far reaches of Mongol World, yet close to our home. As the Crisis of 15th century has come it has opened a potential: A potential for revenge for our ancestor's death. A potential... To return home and take what is rightfully ours: Mongolia."
 tmg_wang_title: "Destroy Wanggiyan"
 tmg_wang_desc: "Our path for retribution is not an easy one, as it is full of mountain ranges, canyons and deserts. However, we ought to make a small detour on our path to our neighbouring Jurchen tribes, more specifically Wanggiyan. If we are to grow we must understand one thing: We are not the greatest Mongol tribe around, so we have to humble ourselves and start our path by invading people closer to our current situation."
 tmg_recruit_title: "Recruit the Jurchen"
 tmg_recruit_desc: "The Jurchens were once subjugated under the Mongol Rule and have been independent for quite some time. We are not too different, however, as we share similar values and traditions. They aren't our brothers, but brethren. We ought to foster a stronger sense of camaraderie with these noble warriors who we are so proud to have by our sides now and in future."
 tmg_korea_title: "Control Korea"
 tmg_korea_desc: "Korea's a land of great importance: It has wealth, agricultural land, and technological marvel. After brief invasion of Korean peninsula the Korenas have been divided between two warring kingdoms: Joseon and Goryeo. We've already ventured into the peninsula and it would be foolish not to finish what we've started."
 tmg_confucian_title: "Confucian Scholars"
 tmg_confucian_desc: "The Confusians are the vilest of all unbelievers as they are utterly irreligious. However, there exists numerous learned individuals and intellectuals among them - many of which can help us. We must swallow our pride and call the aid of the Confucian intelligentsia before we may develop our own that is more virtuous."
 tmg_reckoning_title: "The Hour of Reckoning"
 tmg_reckoning_desc: "We've been the laughing stock for quite sometime - worthless ragged tribe surviving on scraps. World has changed, and our situation has changed. Yuan is in decline, but we are growing stronger and have pacified lands the Yuan had lost control over so many centuries ago. Now, if ever, is our chance to make Temüge proud. Raise the black tugh; Blow the horns of war; Invade Yuan!"
 tmg_mandate_title: "Redefine the Mandate"
 tmg_mandate_desc: "Temugids differ from the rest of Mongols in the way that we embraced a different local religion that was present in China: A monotheistic faith that was in minority and was fabled to have come from mysterious lands of 'Europe' Genghis was close to invading. We believe in the Eastern Christ of Nestorianism. Though the Mandate of Heaven is a concept older than Christianity it is only slightly blasphemous in how it claims the emperor to get the divine right to rule by being a descendant of God. Mandate of Heaven can easily be manipulated into becoming more compatible with the Eastern Bible."
 tmg_north_china_title: "Avenge Prince Nayan"
 tmg_north_china_desc: "Nayan was a bulwark of Mongol identity - a Prince that stood up against the Yuan giant at the sight of growing sinicisation shown by Kublai Khan. Though not a Temügid we have come to see him as a symbol of resistance against the Yuan in year since the time of Kublai Khan, for he, much like Temüge, was wrongly executed for doing what was right. He should not let his rebellion be in vain: We should avenge his fall by pushing Yuan out."
 tmg_reject_title: "Reject Sinification"
 tmg_reject_desc: "We are nothing like the Yuan that disgraced the Mongol ways. We are nothing like the Yuan that disgraced Genghis Khan. We are nothing like the Yuan that disgraced Nayan. We are not Chinese! Sinicisation is the sign of Satan's presence on Earth - a disease that festers upon this land that keeps sprouting if not put out with a fire and zeal. Two centuries were enough to do immense damage to our cultural definition as many of our southernmost brothers have started to imitate the Chinese wretches. Let us cast aside the Chinese snakes and let the Mongol identity re-emerge stronger than ever before - if not even shove it down the throat of the idolatrous Chinese."
 tmg_idols_title: "Destroy the False Idols"
 tmg_idols_desc: "The Eastern Christ is the true Christ, and the Nestorian God is the true god. It is blashemous how darkened by the lies of the false idols the masses are. Temügids are a morning star sitting alone in a dark sky - a dark sky we are obligated to bring light to."
 tmg_middle_title: "The Middle Kingdom"
 tmg_middle_desc: "Temüge, if only you saw where we are now then you would be proud, for we've avenged you! Nayan, if only you saw us then you would be proud, for we've put an end to Sinicisation! Jesus, if only you saw us you would be proud, for we've on our path to rid China from the last of its idolatrous ways! Though the Chinese are a permanent threat to us they are even greater threat if they remain as idol worshippers. That can't do. We must make the values of Chinese match ours, and the way to do that is by conquering the remainder of China under the Mongolian banner. What was once conquered by Genghis shall be conquered by his brother's descendants."
 tmg_christianize_title: "Christianize China"
 tmg_christianize_desc: "We are a morning star - a shining beacon of hope. A giant casting its pious light upon the demons and those seduced by false idols. We are a bringer of light in the sea of darkness. And yet... there lies a darkness within the lightbringer. The Chinese do not all believe in the Christ. There are still many stuck in their ignorant and false ways. This cannot stand. If we are going to be Kingdom of Christians in East we should be a Kingdom of only Christians."
 tmg_mongolia_title: "Rule the Clans"
 tmg_mongolia_desc: "It's time: After centuries of being cast aside from our homeland in Mongolia it is finally time to end Yuan and return to homeland that our ancestors once ruled over. We need to return home as Mongols hardened by the experiences of our journey - as pious Mongols of great wisdom."

 tmg_qaraqorum_title: "Restore Qaraqorum"
 tmg_qaraqorum_desc: "Under Yuan rule the ancestral capital of Mongolia - Qaraqorum - has been disgraced. Yuan housed their capital in Beijing and directed all of their wealth and splendor there, leaving Qaraqorum to wither and die until it stopped being a center of a great empire. The importance of the city may have faded it would be wrong to let it continue its downward decline. Instead we ought to help the city recover atleast a portion of its former glory - under Temügid surveillance."
 tmg_festival_title: "Nadaam Festival"
 tmg_festival_desc: "With Qaraqorum restored to a position of glory we should not stop here. Under Yuan rule the traditional three sports - Wrestling, horse racing, and archery - have fallen into a lesser attraction as Naadam festival lost its luster. If Qaraqorum is to return to its former glory we should glorify its cultural heritage: We should begin putting in funds to commemorate and hold decadely Festivals."
 tmg_patriarch_title: "Establish Patriarchates"
 tmg_patriarch_desc: "Warriors of Christ need Shepherds of Christ. Both are Christ's men, yet we are very lacking in latter. If we are to spread the Christ's word to the unchristened masses and gain new warriors of Christ from them we need more priests. We need to set up legislative areas for patriarchs of the East to govern over, so they may better guide the masses in religious manners."
 tmg_light_title: "The Light of the East"
 tmg_light_desc: "We sit in the dark as the sole light. We are the beacon of hope for all Christians that we know of, and we should aim to become the protectors of Christianity."
 tmg_appease_title: "Appease the Clergy"
 tmg_appease_desc: "We need to ensure for future generations that the Clergy will work together with us. If Nestorians are going to grow in population we need to ensure that the Nestorian priests have necessary tools to do so. If we are going to have a stabel realm we need to ensure the shepherds of the people will be devoted to Temügids."
 tmg_temples_title: "Eastern Style Temples"
 tmg_temples_desc: "If we are going to convert the people to the Christian faith we need to offer it in a more palleable and more attractive light - one that seduces in how familiar it looks. As we build temples we should aim to model them after the temples that are local to the area, rather than base them upon the foreign and alien shapes and methods used in far-away lands. There's a reason these temple styles exist in our lands, and it would be foolish not to adapt our places of worship to fit the mold where necessary."
 tmg_scripture_title: "Translate the Scripture"
 tmg_scripture_desc: "The Bible should be translated to the language of the people if we are going to have the people convert. It will be hard, as the book is filled with words that lack clear translations. We should hire skillful theologians of the faith that have an equally great understanding of both the Biblical and Mongolian tongues so they may create the Mongolian translation for the Bible."
 tmg_nestorian_title: "Nestorian Universities"
 tmg_nestorian_desc: "Education should be a way to achieve greater understanding of God and God's world. We should set up religious schools dedicated towards understanding of world that God has created for us so we may eventually gain a generation that is smart without being heathenous."
 tmg_chosen_title: "God's Chosen"
 tmg_chosen_desc: "The Dark Age of Idolatry is coming to a close, for Temügids are riding down from the Heavens with an angelic choir and a blazing sword, forcing it to enter the new Brighter Age of Christian times. For Millennias Asia has been a den of sin and corruption, but no longer. We will push the darkness of the past to the corners of the world and prove to God our fervorous dedication to our faith."

Our eyes have been pointed at the islands for many years, our generals pointing out that our forces are superior to theirs in every aspect, and now we find ourselves ready for an invasion. However, before an outright invasion, our advisors have found it prudent to first request their vassalage via diplomatic means.

 china_hermit_title: "The Hermit Kingdom"
 china_hermit_desc: "To some, we are the hermit kingdom due to our natural inclination to defensive battles.

When our troops marched through the streets of the freshly conquered city along with our ruler he saw only a city of decadence - a city of sin and evil. It was a city without any pride, only temptation. It showed the weakness of Man in its history and architecture. It was not always like this. In years before the coming of Romans it was a prominent fishing village of great trade due to it being the merging point of two continents. If we are to properly rule over this city we need to put an end to the Roman decadence by putting an end to the capital and restore it to its innocent years.

 nicene_refugees_title: "Accept Roman Refugees"
 nicene_refugees_desc: "Some would say we hate Romans, but that is wrong. We hate Rome that has brainwashed our fellow Greek speaking peoples into believing that they are the same people as Latin imposters. We hate Rome for how it represents corruption and decadence and selfish greed. We hate Rome, but not its citizens. If we accept in the Roman refugees we can do our best to make them make a new home in Nicaea and undo the damage Rome did to their identities."
 nicene_countryside_title: "Restore Greek Countryside"
 nicene_countryside_desc: "War, Plague and misplacement of peoples have resulted in the countryside becoming devoid of population while cities grew more and more overcrowded.

What are we who have had our identity squashed and washed into vile Rome's subjects through centuries of subjugation? Greeks. We are Greeks, and we know it, and so should our subjects remember that. Our identity was replaced with that of Roman one for far too long, but we will now re-embrace our true identity as Greeks of Mediterranean - The bed of western civilization."
 nicene_eclipse_title: "Eclipse the West"
 nicene_eclipse_desc: "The western nations have come to admire our arts through a western lens since the days of Renaissance, but their appreciation of the Greek arts and wisdom is wrong: It is but a crude mimicry. They are barbarians dressing up in civilized clothing. We ought to show the Western Europe that the center of Europe is not in Paris or in Rome or in Aachen, but in Nicaea."
 nicene_greek_fire_desc: "When they seemed doomed, the Romans were often saved by a formidable weapon, Greek fire, capable of destroying an entire fleet. Although the secret of its manufacture is jealously guarded, some individuals - driven by the ruin of the empire - would no doubt be likely to provide it."
 nicene_aegean_desc: "Dividing Europe and Asia, the Aegean Sea is not only an important commercial crossroads but also a highly strategic location for anyone wishing to dominate the region. While for centuries it has been the exclusive property of the Romans, it is time we took full control of it."
 nicene_latins_desc: "Although they failed to take Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, the Latins nevertheless managed to establish themselves permanently in the region. Now that we are the masters, it is time to drive them out forever, to punish them for their treachery and secure our influence in the area."
 nicene_smyrna_desc: "Smyrna is one of the last Roman strongholds in Anatolia. By seizing the province, we would deprive the empire of an important port and resources from Asia, thus dealing it a decisive blow."
 nicene_byzantium_desc: "It is the city of the world's desire. Unviolated for centuries, no enemy has yet reached its heart. Some say it is impregnable, but it seems to us that the death knell has sounded for the Roman Empire. Constantinople is ours!"

 nicene_hellenic_desc: "From the outset, we have followed in the footsteps of Alexander the Great. War after war, battle after battle, we defeated the enemy armies that stood between us and our destiny. Now the truth is undeniable, we are the true heirs of Alexander. Long live the Hellenic Empire!"
 nicene_bulgaria_desc: "Taking advantage of the weakness of the Roman Empire in the east and the absence of a major rival in the west, the Bulgarians acquired an already substantial kingdom and even dreamed of becoming an empire. Sadly for them, the truth is coming, hanging on the spike of our sarissas."

 nicene_fortify_desc: "Our legions are powerful, capable of defeating any army. However, we remain vulnerable to an enemy landing. If we do not want them to take advantage of this opportunity, we must at all costs implement new means of defence in order to guarantee the integrity of our coastline."
 nicene_sack_desc: "Two centuries ago, the Venetians wanted to take advantage of the crusade and the generosity of the Basileus to besiege and take Constantinople. Although they failed miserably, we do not forget their treachery and it is now time for them to pay the ultimate price."
 nicene_egypt_desc: "Following the death of Alexander, General Ptolemy was appointed satrap of Egypt, thus facilitating the administrative management of the empire. We could similarly delegate Egypt to a governor in order to concentrate on the heart of the empire and our future conquests. There is, however, the minor problem of simply having to ensure his unfailing loyalty..."
 nicene_mesopotamia_desc: "Mesopotamia is of singular importance to us. The cradle of civilisation, it is also the place where it all ended, where Alexander tragically died in Babylon, plunging his empire into decades of instability and internal strife. Now that we are on its doorstep, all that remains is for us to take possession of this highly symbolic region as our sacred duty requires us to do"
 nicene_persepolis_desc: "Centuries earlier, the city of Persepolis was burnt down by Alexander in retaliation for the sack of Athens by Xerxes. Now that we have recaptured the city, we have the choice of continuing Alexander's legacy or ending this cycle of revenge and securing the support of the local population."
 nicene_shah_desc: "Now that we have completed the conquest of Persia, we could, like Alexander before us, crown ourselves Shahanshah, king of kings. In this way we would show the whole region that we are not their oppressor but rather their legitimate ruler."
 nicene_bactria_desc: "Having pushed his conquests as far as India, Alexander the Great left a multitude of Greek kingdoms in his wake. Although these are now only a distant memory, the culture and influence of the Bactrian kingdoms can still be felt, encouraging us to re-establish our rule in the area."
 nicene_india_desc: "Before our eyes lie the ancient borders of Alexander's empire. He who has been our model all this time has seen his work finally completed again. It is now up to us to go beyond him and to continue our conquests ever further, towards this new continent that is now opening up to us."
 nicene_legions_desc: "Inheriting both the best of the Greek and Roman worlds, our armies are feared by all our neighbours. Their iron discipline and high morale make them our best tool for dominating our rivals. Therefore, we must not hesitate to develop our legions further."
 nicene_levantine_title: "Levantine Campaign"

 ilk_rekindle_desc: "The sacred flames of Zoroaster have been stamped out in the wake of Sassanid territorial contraction. To ensure the future of our faith, we must restore these holy sites."
 ilk_monument_desc: "The fire temple of Baku is an ancient site of the faith. This monument will serve as a new center of religion in our empire."
 ilk_persianate_desc: "Our language, court culture, and traditions have eroded over the centuries from their Mongol roots, transforming into something new entirely. It seems that like every great conqueror of Persia, we have fallen victim to cultural conversion by our own subjects. But no matter..."
 ilk_stabilize_desc: "The changes to our realm have not gone over well with some of our subjects. In order to prevent further infighting, it is imperative that we project an image of stability and authority."
 ilk_court_desc: "The court of the Khan has been dominated by local Persians for long enough that integrating them into formal administrative roles only seems like the natural next step in our gradual persianization."
 ilk_iranzamin_desc: "Having reformed our religion, court, and state, it is only natural that we adopt a new identity as a nation. Henceforth, the world will know Iranzamin as the only successor to the ancient Achaemenid empire, and the true suzerains of Iran."
 ilk_outposts_desc: "The rich lands of India are opening up to foreign traders like never before. Considering our proximity, we should establish ourselves as among the first to claim land in India for ourselves."
 ilk_spice_desc: "The lucrative spice trade is dominated in the east by the kingdoms of the Malaccan straits, but further west, control is more dispersed. If we seize control of this coveted resource, we can even further increase our trade profits. The Spice Road will be just as vital as the Silk Road."
 ilk_bahrain_desc: "Bahrain is a lucrative territory in that trade flows through it, and it is strategically important for military affairs in the Gulf. We'd do ourselves a disservice by letting it go unconquered."
 ilk_arabia_desc: "Like the Sassanids before us, we shall conquer the Gulf Coast Arabs. It is only right that the people of the Persian Gulf be ruled by their eponymous Persian overlords."
 ilk_academy_desc: "Gondishapur in Ctesiphon shall be the site of a great center of scholarship, staffed by the most learned men in Iranzamin, open to those of all colors, creeds, and classes. Scientific advancement and learning have always been central values of Persian empires."
 ilk_ctesiphon_desc: "After nearly a millennia of Arab rule in the region, the former City of Ctesiphon is nothing more than a complex of ruins eclipsed by Baghdad. We will avenge this wrongdoing and restore the great capital of Mithridates."
 ilk_nahrawan_desc: "The irrigation systems of Mesopotamia, previously some of the most advanced in the world, have fallen to the grips of nature during the centuries of war that have plagued the region. Under our stable rule, we can rebuild the farming infrastructure, starting with a great canal to expand the arable area of the land."
 ilk_industrial_desc: "Silk, spices, paper, bread, and rugs are just some of the goods we are famous for exporting. In the wake of new technology, we can produce at a rate never seen before, putting our massive population to good use in factories, large farms, and workshops, where they will handle new machines and manufacture the goods of the future."
 ilk_bread_desc: "Just as Egypt was a breadbasket to the Roman and Byzantine empires, we shall make use of the Tigris and Euphrates to transform the Mashriq into our very own granary."
 ilk_indus_desc: "With our foothold in India, it seems only right to set out to do what no Iranian empire has done before, and dominate Hindustan itself, starting with the fertile Indus River valley."
 ilk_dread_title: "Mounted Dread"
 ilk_dread_desc: "The way of the steppe beckons. Our ancestors, should they be alive and by our side at this very moment, would balk at the composition of armies today. Let us honour them and return to the ways of the open plains- mounted, unstoppable, invincible dread." 
 ilk_guard_title: "Restore the Kheshig Guard"
 ilk_guard_desc: "The symbol of our powerful horde, our khan is feared throughout the world. However, his power is the envy of many and some would not hesitate to kill him to take his place. For this reason, the khan needs a loyal guard, ready to protect him at all costs, day and night. Genghis Khan had given us an example: the Kheshig guard must be restored!"
 ilk_central_asia_title: "Restore Rule on the Steppe"
 ilk_central_asia_desc: "With Persia secured, we can no longer let the central steppe go ignored. During the height of the Great Khan, all of the plains laid within our grasp. One could ride unmolested from Khanbaliq to Sarai. Let us extend our grasp across the steppe once more and remind its petty horse lords who their rightful Khan is."
 ilk_tibet_title: "Rule Tibet"
 ilk_tibet_desc: "Not only does Tibet stand as a vital mountain region, rife with gateways to further conquests, it is also the ancestral home of the Dalai Lama. Offering the Dalai Lama and his folk protection and safe passage on the lonesome Tibetan plateau would cement the Ilkhanate's position as the successor-state of the Great Khan and perhaps even secure the Dalai Lama's respect and endorsement." 
 ilk_gateway_title: "Gateway to India"
 ilk_gateway_desc: "Tibet was not an easy conquest, owing to its harsh climate and insular peoples. Further south, beyond the mighty Himalayas, lay Nepal and Kashmir, rich, bountiful and ripe pickings for our resurgent strength. Should we lay waste to the region, we may use the consolidated Himalayas as a gateway to greater India."
 ilk_maharajas_title: "Defeat the Maharajas"
 ilk_maharajas_desc: "The vast and sprawling lands of India, rich in wealth, blood and glory, lay in a shattered state. The foolish Maharajas seek to establish hegemonic power over the region, but to no avail. We shall introduce to these people our Khan's wisdom and in turn grant them a true Maharaja, in turn carrying out the dreams our forefathers could not achieve."
 ilk_capture_capital_title: "Capture the Old Capital"
 ilk_capture_capital_desc: "Qaraqorum sits as the ancestral home of our legacy. Once, the Great Khan rode out from its humble walls to conquer the world. To let it sit beyond our grasp is truly an insult to his name- for are we not the inheritors of his strength, his title, his wisdom? Qaraqorum and all of old Mongolia must be reclaimed."
 ilk_qaraqorum_title: "Rebuild Qaraqorum"
 ilk_qaraqorum_desc: "Qaraqorum stands neglected today, a lonely vestige of the old ways on a lonelier steppe. A city with such an important legacy, such a history, should not be unnoticeable to those humble travellers who pass it by. Its walls must stand mighty, its palaces must bustle and its merchants must be the most rich and industrious of the Silk Road, until it too can be seen as a city worthy of being called a capital, should we deem it so."
 ilk_festival_title: "Nadaam Festival"
 ilk_festival_desc: "With Qaraqorum under our wise rule, it stands unthinkable that the Nadaam Festival is forgotten and relegated to petty local recreations. A decannual festival of the Mongol people, it saw many a fierce young man participate in wrestling, archery and horsemanship. Not only did it bring people together, but it also introduced the youth to the cherished military traditions of our people and create many a potential warrior out of those once deemed unworthy."
 ilk_warlords_title: "The Middle Kingdom"
 ilk_warlords_desc: "The south of China has devolved into utter chaos. The decadent Mongol rulers who have been swept aside by our masterful hand have left us a truly awful mess to clean up. South of China is now filled with warlords that have fought against our rule for centuries and harm our legitimacy. This cannot do. We need to show the Chinese that resistance is futile and it is their eternal fate to serve under the Mongol Yoke."
 ilk_mongols_title: "Reuniting the Mongols"
 ilk_mongols_desc: "The Mongols today stand in a sorry state. They squabble with one another over the rule of China- torn between various strange faiths and philosophies, embittered by old family rivalries and peppered with sedentary decadence exuded by the Chinese peasantry they once dominated. Should we remind them of the old ways and teach them of our resurgent capacities, they will flock to our fold and Mongolia will become a heartland of our rising empire."
 ilk_nchina_title: "Reclaim North China"
 ilk_nchina_desc: "With Mongol loyalty secured, China's fertile, flat plains lay vulnerable. Should we sweep through this region, razing, ransacking and claiming what is ours, it will serve China a reminder of its place beneath our heel and embolden and educate our eager men in the ways of siege warfare- specifically, those against the cowardly cities of the so-called Middle Kingdom."
 ilk_manchuria_title: "Manchurian Incursion"
 ilk_manchuria_desc: "The Mongols are a proud and valuable asset, but we must not ignore their eastern neighbours and think ourselves overly secure and mighty. The peoples of Manchuria are a wise and fearsome steppe people much like us, with a wealth of manpower and resources we can utilise for further conquest. Furthermore, the unruly and tattered state of their leadership means any border shared with them is a fundamentally unsafe one- thus their loyalty is imperative."
 ilk_yam_title: "Restore the Yam"
 ilk_yam_desc: "The yam was a postal system and supply point route messenger system extensively used and expanded by Ogedei Khan and subsequent Great Khans. Following the Empire's collapse, the entire system also collapsed. With our wisdom and propserity, it shall be restored and elevate our power and efficiency to new heights."
 ilk_caucasia_title: "Rule Caucasia"
 ilk_caucasia_desc: "We would be foolish to ignore the mountain realm to our north. Should we capture Caucasia proper, not only would we gain a wealth of manpower from the bored and restless valley tribes, but also the vital mountain passes to the great steppe beyond."
 ilk_crimea_title: "Capture Crimea"
 ilk_crimea_desc: "Crimea stands as a vital cornerstone of trade at the far end of the Silk Road. While its petty riches and mercantile significance is appealing, its true worth to us is that of a base of military operations. Should we secure it, we could at last resume and carry out our well-deserved conquest of the rich and mysterious Europe." 
 ilk_yoke_title: "The Mongol Yoke"
 ilk_yoke_desc: "Ruthenia has submitted and at our feet stands many a petty kingdom in need of true overlordship. Let us extend our strength across these lost and misguided peasants and enrich our coffers with what resources they can muster."
 ilk_ruthenia_title: "Ruin Ruthenia"
 ilk_ruthenia_desc: "Centuries ago, we swept through Ruthenia and battered down the doors of the cowardly and feeble peasantry, coveting riches and goods rightfully ours. We have not forgotten this glorious conquest- but apparently the peasants of Ruthenia have, for they have erected of themselves silly little kingdoms oblivious of who their true rulers are, daring to mimic our traditions and mastery of the region's climate. Let us tear to shreds this insolent self-determination."
 ilk_sarai_title: "Capture Sarai"
 ilk_sarai_desc: "Our brethren to the north have made of themselves blundering fools. They find themselves disunited, pursuing strange faiths and devoid of all military competence. Let us teach them the way of the steppe, for they have surely forgotten it- and deprive them of the legendary and bountiful Sarai, founded by the Great Khan himself, who would surely balk at its current ownership."
 ilk_golden_horde_title: "Ulug Ulus"
 ilk_golden_horde_desc: "The Golden Horde was once a force to be feared. It invoked terror in the hearts of the steppe Christians and the Rus alike. Let us purge the last vestiges of its current pathetic leadership, restore its honour and claim the region for ourselves."
 ilk_raze_title: "Raze Rus' to the Ground"
 ilk_raze_desc: "The internal trouble within the Golden Horde created a power vacuum which was swiftly abused by the rebellious princedoms of Rus' who defied the Mongol rule. The time has come to put them in their place and inflict devastation so massive that even the Destruction of Kievan Rus' will pale in comparison to it." 
 ilk_mongol_empire_title: "Restore the Mongol Empire" 
 ilk_mongol_empire_desc: "From our humble, precarious position in Persia, we have swept across the former holdings of the Great Khan and restored our honour. For too long, the empire of Genghis Khan has laid fallen, broken into many parts. We must restore his legacy by replicating the Great Khan's conquests. We will reconquer the Mongol Empire!"
 #GenericSlavic
 ab_slavic_warriors_title: "Warriors of Perun" 
 ab_slavic_warriors_desc: "All across the Slavic world, no army is feared more than the Warriors of Perun. Holy warriors who will fight and die for our faith. Recruiting these skilled warriors to our army will grant us the strength to overcome the armies of Christ." 
 ab_slavic_arkona_title: "Renovate Arkona" 
 ab_slavic_arkona_desc: "The most sacred site in all of Slavdom is the Holy Temple of Arkona, but compared to the grand cathedrals of the Christians, it is a bit underwhelming. Renovations and improved iconography will put us on par with the Christians and legitimize our claim to be the guardians of the faith to our people."
 ab_slavic_sites_title: "Control the Holy Sites" 
 ab_slavic_sites_desc: "The holy sites of our faith have been under control of numerous different tribes and statelets over the centuries, but this disorganized control has only weakened our faith to outsiders. Already the city of Kiev has fallen to the Christians, and the crusader states in the Baltic and Germany threaten these sacred places. It is up to us to guard these sites from heathens." 
 ab_slavic_reform_title: "Reform the Religion" 
 ab_slavic_reform_desc: "Times are changing, and the need to centralize our beliefs into a uniform code is becoming increasingly necessary when faced against the onslaught of missionaries from the Christian world. The creation of a central church hierarchy and a codified holy book will entrench the belief of Perun in our subjects, although our neighbors will have to be taught the new ways by force."
#Pomerania 
 pom_seize_lusatia_title: "Seize Lusatia" 
 pom_seize_lusatia_desc: "The Sorbs in Lusatia are the last barrier between the Catholic world and Pomerania, keeping the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Emperor away from Wendia; but they shouldn’t have to face off against the Soldiers of Christ alone, integrating them into the duchy will strengthen our position and scare off the Catholics from invading." 
 pom_rival_veleti_title: "Rival Veleti" 
 pom_rival_veleti_desc: "The closest threat to the Duke is our rival the Veleti, and years of conflict and raids between our people have resulted in little to no changes in the border. It is time to raise the levy and prepare to face off against the Veleti one last time, for this time we will destroy them permanently." 
 pom_wendish_power_title: "New Wendish Power" 
 pom_wendish_power_desc: "With the threat of the Veleti dealt with and the Sorbs under our control, we have proven to the world that we are the number one Wendish power. United under our Duke, the Wendish shall become the new Superpower of Central Europe. " 
 pom_wendish_title: "Unite the Polabian Tribes" 
 pom_wendish_desc: "The last of the Wendish people would be the Polabian tribes to the west. The Polabians have struggled the most against the Germans by curbing the eastward expansion of the Hanseatic league. Incorporating them into our state, we will become the ruler of all the Wends." 
 pom_hansa_title: "Sack Hanseatic Towns" 
 pom_hansa_desc: "The Hanseatic League has been continuously expanding their influence in the Batlic, and their capital city of Hamburg is the shining jewel of Germany. Destroying the league and sacking their most precious cities will destroy any threat of a German invasion." 
 pom_naval_title: "Naval Buildup" 
 pom_naval_desc: "Times are changing, and although the battle on land is important, the naval sector has become more prevalent in the Baltic. The Hanseatic League and Viking raids to the north have made it increasingly clear that we need a navy capable of defending our shores." 
 pom_centers_title: "Baltic Trade Centers" 
 pom_centers_desc: "The Baltic is no longer the isolated world it once was, trade and ideas have begun to flow across Wendia. Investing in cities and building trade centers will propel us to be the trade hegemon of the Baltic." 
 pom_pruthenia_title: "Conquer Pruthenia" 
 pom_pruthenia_desc: "The Pruthenians are an ancient people who have recently faltered to a crusade in Danzig. We can not allow such a state to exist, and if we have to subjugate the Pruthenians to prevent their expansion, then that is what we shall do." 
 pom_polans_title: "Invade Polania" 
 pom_polans_desc: "To our east is the Catholic rump state of Polans who once tried to force their heathen god upon the Poles. While they have weakened in Poland's collapse, they still pose a threat to Pomerania and all of Slavdom." 
 pom_danzig_title: "Banish the Crusaders" 
 pom_danzig_desc: "The Crusader State of Danzig almost destroyed the Pruthenians in their initial crusade, and even with their weakened power, they still pose a threat to our brothers in the Slavic faith. We will push the pesky Germans back to the sea and kick out the Crusader Orders forevermore!" 
 pom_domination_title: "Dominate the Poles" 
 pom_domination_desc: "The Poles remain one of the most resilient groups in all of Slavdom, resisting all attempts to conquer or convert them, their desire to protect their homeland makes them resilient fighters. It would be wise to conquer such a people to make a buffer between the Orthodox and Pomeranian heartlands." 
 pom_moravia_title: "Dismantle Moravia" 
 pom_moravia_desc: "The Great Moravian Empire once united all of the Western Slavs under one King, and while the days of Moravian domination are long over, they still lay claim to our land and our people. The Moravian kingdom must be put down once and for all, and their heathen god must burn with them." 
 pom_bohemia_title: "Conquer Bohemia" 
 pom_bohemia_desc: "The Crown of Bohemia is the major stronghold of Christian Slavs, converted centuries ago by Holy Roman intervention; they maintain a false religion and pay homage to a defunct and inglorious emperor to the West. Reuniting the Czech people with the true faith will be hard, but we did not choose our destiny to rule the Slavs, we merely follow it." 
 pom_silesia_title: "Claim Silesia" 
 pom_silesia_desc: "The last of the Polish tribes remain in Silesia, a fertile and productive land that stands as the crossroads between the east and west. Their lands are desired from every neighboring power, including us, so it is only right for us to subjugate them first to prevent false faiths from being spread among the Siliesians." 
 #Lusatia
 sor_independence_title: "Gain Independence"
 sor_independence_desc: "Our overlords are struggling to keep the Wendish region safe from the Teutonic terror. We must find a way to free ourselves from the vassalage and forge a better future for our people."
 sor_barlin_title: "Conquer Barlin"
 sor_barlin_desc: "The city of Barlin has long been the center of the Wendish culture. If we wish to become the new hegemon of the region, we must claim the city for ourselves."
 sor_restore_title: "Restore the Confederation"
 sor_restore_desc: "Veleti confederation protected the Wendish people for centuries, but the High Priests grew weaker and the country was subjected to increased German attacks. Under our leadership, the Veleti Confederation shall be reborn, but this time, led by the King of Lusatia!"

 #Wendia
 wee_consolidate_wendia_title: "Consolidate the Union"
 wee_consolidate_wendia_desc: "While we have formally united Wendia under our banner, there still remain some tribes not under our direct control. Before we can begin our New European Order, we have to consolidate the rest of our people."
 wee_government_title: "The Wendish Government"
 wee_government_desc: "The diverse tribes of Wendia each have their own laws and systems that conflict with each other. A formal court and code of laws must be established to ensure that all legal issues are settled peacefully and that the Crown has final say in all legal matters."
 wee_hansa_title: "Sack the Hansa"
 wee_hansa_desc: "The Hanseatic League is one of the richest institutions in the world, and contains a vast majority of that wealth in banks across the league. Not only would sacking these cities help ease our financial burdens, but it would also serve as the beginning of our grand conquest of Germany and destruction of the Holy Roman Empire."
 wee_defy_title: "Defy the Germans"
 wee_defy_desc: "The Germans once posed a significant threat to the Wendish, through migrations and crusades, our culture could have been destroyed over centuries; but now, we have begun our invasion of Germany, and we will not stop until every Wendish death is repaid tenfold!"
 wee_wrath_title: "Wrath of the Old Gods"
 wee_wrath_desc: "The followers of Perun were once on the backfoot, being pushed further and further back into their heartland by the forces of the cross. Fate would be on the side of Perun however, and the Old Gods struck back against the Christians, destroying their churches, razing their land, and spreading the light of Perun all across Europe once more."
 wee_marches_title: "Tame Nordmark"
 wee_marches_desc: "After the Hansa, the next German threat would be the Marches on the Sorbian border. Their continual occupation over native Wendish land can no longer be tolerated. Just as they have evicted us before, we shall kindly return the favor and send them all the way back to the Rhein."
 wee_bornholm_title: "Seize Bornholm"
 wee_bornholm_desc: "The Baltic sea is beginning to become one of the most profitable seas in the world, with trade flowing from Denmark to Rus, its profits will only grow over the years. To ensure we get in on the profits, we need to establish trade ports on the numerous islands in the sea, and the island of Bornholm serves as a prime candidate for such an operation."
 wee_sound_toll_title: "Control the Sound Toll"
 wee_sound_toll_desc: "Any merchant that passes in and out of the Baltic must pay the sound toll to the Danes. This completely unjust policy has done nothing but rob proper Wendish merchants of their hard earned cash. Conquering the Danish heartlands and taking over the Sound toll will ensure that our merchants and everyone else's merchants are paying us directly, and not some Odin-worshiping heathens."
 wee_destroy_empire_title: "Destroy the Empire"
 wee_destroy_empire_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire has always been the biggest threat to the Wendish people, their relentless drive east almost crushed the disunited tribes in the past, but the boot is on the other foot now. Only after Paris, Frankfurt, Aachen, and every other Palace is burned and their crowns shattered will we finally know peace as a people."
 wee_shatter_title: "Shatter East Francia"
 wee_shatter_desc: "East Francia was one of the successor states to the Empire of Charlemagne, and its evolution into the mess of states in the form of the Holy Roman Empire is a sign of their failures as rulers. Conquering one of the original three kingdoms of Charlemagne will strike a devastating blow to imperial prestige and morale allowing us to push further west."
 wee_aachen_title: "Burn Aachen to Ash"
 wee_aachen_desc: "The city of Aachen was the capital of the Holy Roman Empire, and serves as one of the free cities in the Empire. The Cathedral and the throne of Charlemagne still reside in the city, and until it is destroyed, there will always be a claimant to the defunct throne of Charlemagne. We will burn it to the ground and salt the city to never let any German or Frank near the throne again."
 wee_new_order_title: "New European Order"
 wee_new_order_desc: "Europe has been under the yoke of the Christian feudal lords for over a millenia now, and the order they established seemed almost entrenched and inseparable from the lands. This has been rectified by our Magnificent conquest of Central Europe and destruction of anyone who dared oppose us. Germany, Wendia, Poland, all under one ruler, a new order that reigns from Burgundy to Russia. As long as the sun shines on Wendia, no nation on Earth can ever hope to defeat the might of Perun."
 wee_poland_title: "Invade Poland"
 wee_poland_desc: "The Poles have been infighting for over a few centuries now, and it seems that no end is in sight. Our brothers in blood and faith need our help, now more than ever, and we will gladly establish overlordship over them to protect them from foreign threats, forever."
 wee_lechitic_title: "Lechitic Domination"
 wee_lechitic_desc: "The rest of Poland has been conquered, and while each tribe has slowly diverged in culture and beliefs, they still speak one common tongue. The Poles will be reunited once more as a core part of our nation, and their people will fight alongside the Wends as brothers and equals."
 wee_moravia_title: "Subjugate Moravia"
 wee_moravia_desc: "Great Moravia was once the unifier of the West Slavs, but their fall from grace and abandonment of Perun only proves the failure of Christianization. However, they still are our brothers in blood, and it is up to us to reunite the West Slavs and welcome them into our nation, but only if they accept Perun."
 wee_carpathia_title: "Carpathian Intervention"
 wee_carpathia_desc: "Through their own incompetence, the Moravians have let the Magyar hordes into the grasslands of Carpathia, and now they pose a significant risk to all of Europe with their ever-growing raiding force. The Magyars will be expelled back to their ancestral homelands and the followers of Perun will reclaim their rightful place as rulers of Carpathia."
 wee_bohemia_title: "Control Bohemia"
 wee_bohemia_desc: "The Bohemians are the most cowardly of all the Slavs, abandoning Perun and accepting German domination over them. It is a sad state of affairs, and only we can reeducate them on Perun and liberate them from the Germans. Only then will they be accepted into our new order."
 wee_banish_title: "Banish the Crusaders"
 wee_banish_desc: "The Crusaders in Danzig have deranged dreams of grandeur, believing they can lead a crusade against the Pruthenians and convert them to Catholicism. Their attempt is pathetic, but we should not risk letting them succeed in their goal. Conquering Danzig and kicking them out of the Baltic should prevent any more Christian threats from coming."
 wee_pruthenia_title: "Unite with Pruthenia"
 wee_pruthenia_desc: "The Pruthenians are a proud but misguided people. Their belief in a different set of gods is worrying, but at least they do not claim there to be only one god. By showing them the true way and integrating them into our empire, our control over the Baltic will only grow."
 wee_baltoslavic_title: "Balto-Slavic Union"
 wee_baltoslavic_desc: "The Baltic states stand at a crossroads between Slavic, Orthodox, and Nordic kingdoms. We cannot afford letting one of our rivals conquer the region before us, the Baltic is our dominion and our dominion alone, and the tribes will have to learn to accept Wendish rule and Perun."
 wee_kralowc_title: "Found Kralowc"
 wee_kralowc_desc: "The Pruthenian coast is rich in Amber and other precious gems, and this has attracted a large community of merchants and artisans to the region. A new city has sprouted up and is rapidly growing to become the center of the Baltic. With a little investment from the state, the newly named city of Kralowc will become a shining jewel in the Baltic."
 wee_barlin_title: "Gord Barlin"
 wee_barlin_desc: "The swamps of Barlin provide a unique natural defense against any besieging army. Plans for a Fortress to be constructed in the town will not only force any invading army to waste their resources on taking an impregnable fort, but also allow governors and bureaucrats to administer the government more efficiently without the fear of peasants throwing rotten fruit at them."
 wee_capital_title: "Develop the Capital"
 wee_capital_desc: "Our capital is a bit underwhelming when compared to others such as Paris or Roma, but this can be changed with a bit of investment. Roads, statues, and sewers will be constructed and local tribes will be encouraged to emigrate into the city. Rome might not have been built in a day, but we can build a city to rival Rome in a decade."
 wee_urbanize_title: "Urbanize Wendia"
 wee_urbanize_desc: "Times are changing, villages and tribes are no longer the center of power they once were. As time moves forward and farming technology advances, cities grow more and more populous, becoming centers of entire regions. These new cities will drive Wendia from a regional power to the new global hegemon, unconquerable and wealthy beyond measure!"
 wee_merchant_fleet_title: "Build a Merchant Fleet"
 wee_merchant_fleet_desc: "The Baltic sea’s wealth is out there, but the lack of a merchant navy means we can not exploit it to its full potential. An official Wendish trade fleet will be constructed and manned to ensure that the wealth of the Baltic belongs to us."
 wee_port_title: "Port of Szczecin"
 wee_port_desc: "The Pomerian port of Szczecin has grown to become a major trade center in the baltic. Wendish and Danish traders sail in and out at a near continuous rate,  and with support from the state, the port can grow ever larger, rivaling even the Hanseatic cities in wealth and splendor."
 wee_dread_title: "Baltic Dreadnought"
 wee_dread_desc: "The Baltic sea is ruled by numerous naval powers all vying for control of the sea. The Danes, Swedes, Russians, and Hansa all desire control over the Baltic. We will not tolerate other powers threatening our position in the Baltic. A new flagship shall be constructed to destroy our naval rivals!"
 wee_wooden_title: "Break the Wooden Wall"
 wee_wooden_desc: "The greatest naval power in the world is sadly not us, but the English with their supposed wooden wall. For Wendia to become the sole naval hegemon, we have to sink this feared English symbol.."
 wee_merchants_title: "Appease the Merchants"
 wee_merchants_desc: "The growing merchant class has grown from near nonexistence to one of the most influential factions in Wendia. By courting them to our side, we can ensure economic growth for Wendia."
 wee_discover_title: "Discover the New World"
 wee_discover_desc: "Perun has blessed Wendia by showing us a new world filled with resources and riches. Sadly, we know very little about this new continent, and we have to chart out the new world to ensure that it belongs to Wendia."
 wee_caribbean_title: "Riches of the Caribbean"
 wee_caribbean_desc: "The Caribbean contains goods unheard of in Wendia. Sugar, rum, coffee, and tobacco are all produced in the Caribbean. The merchants demand that we create a monopoly on such goods and promise us riches for them."
 wee_coast_title: "Settle the East Coast"
 wee_coast_desc: "The eastern coast of this new world is similar to our ancestral homeland, and the societal and economic migration towards this new land has become a tad unregulated. Seizing direct control of this new land and guiding settlers to them will create a new dominion for us to rule over while getting rid of unproductive citizens in our heartlands"
 wee_colonial_empire_title: "Wendish Empire"
 wee_colonial_empire_desc: "The conquest of central Europe is not enough for Perun, to truly spread his light, we must conquer territory all around the world. No corner of the Earth shall be safe from Wendish armies and the wealth of the world will fill our coffers forevermore!"

We have united it under the Cross of Christ and pushed out both rebellious Niceneans and heathenous Seljuks. We have brought salvation and proven ourselves as Christians...\n\n... And yet there are rumors. Sneering stares and whispers about how Europeans do not perceive us as equals, despite both of us being christians. Some would say they do not believe we are capable of being true Christians simply by existing outside of the borders of Europe. We need to prove them wrong, which requires placing ourselves upon a warpath - a warpath of legitimization.\n\nWith great tears we need to bid Rome its farewell, for they stand in the path of us becoming equal to our Christian brethren.

We do not have either, as we are the exception in the history of Southern Slavs. We've had not one but two golden ages, have brought the Romans on their knees and on brink of extinction twice now. We are the first Slavs to civilize from our tribal origins as Barbarians, while the other slavs merely tried imitating us. We are what the southern slavs dream of becoming - civilized. We ought to unite all of Southern Slavs under our rule and give them the velvet glove. All Southern Slavs shall be united, with Bulgarians having a hegemony over the rest."

After 634 that pentarchy was reduced to two - Rome and Constantinople. Jerusalem has been the target of most desires for pious reasons among the Christians. Crusades have managed to reclaim it from the infidels, but the city is under a constant threat of falling under muslim control. It is only fit to perceive this risk as a sign that Catholics are unfit to rule over the holy cities. We should reclaim Jerusalem for all of Christendom-... No, for only Orthodox Christianity."

After 634 that pentarchy was reduced to two - Rome and Constantinople. Alexandria is the most forgotten of the pentarchy cities, and the most converted of them due to it serving as the capital of an Islamic regime - Nizzarids.

As we have grown stronger, richer, and more influential in Eastern Europe, the strengthening of the Church must be a significant goal to secure their support for our nation.

Without dominion over such a strategically crucial area, it’s doubtful that we can ever hope to extend our reach past the Bosphorus. Of course, this serves the double purpose of bringing more Orthodox Greeks into our own domain as well."

It’s about time that we impose true Orthodoxy onto them, and make a historic push across the Bosphorus.

 byzantium_cyprus_desc: "We must reclaim Cyprus from the corrupt Latin crusaders. It was an integral part of the empire and also an important naval launching position."
 byzantium_macedonia_title: "Recover Macedonia" 
 byzantium_macedonia_desc: "Without Macedonia under our control, the Bulgarians are dangerously close to the Greek lands and the heart of our empire. We must recover Macedonia to keep the Bulgarians at bay and secure the Northwestern front."
 byzantium_bulgar_title: "Boulgaroktonos"
 byzantium_bulgar_desc: "The Turks are the greatest threat from the east, and the Bulgarians are the greatest threat from the northwest. No longer shall we fear the encroachment of the Bulgarian state, but rather will conquer and subjugate them. The legacy of the great Boulgaroktonos shall be revived."
 byzantium_romanians_title: "Subjugate the Vlachs"
 byzantium_romanians_desc: "A garrison of the Roman army during ancient, imperial times, the land of the Vlachs is ripe for conquest following our subjugation of the Bulgarians. We shall conquer this land to restore our imperial glory."
 byzantium_crimea_title: "Grip over Crimea" 
 byzantium_crimea_desc: "Crimea is home to the Tatars and the remnants of the Goths. It too was once part of our empire, and we must secure our control over this region to maintain our trade supremacy in the Black Sea."
 byzantium_dacia_title: "Magna Dacia"
 byzantium_dacia_desc: "The region of Greater Dacia shall now be under our control. With our recent conquests we have finally unified Magna Dacia as an imperial province. Triumph in Dacia!"
 byzantium_balkans_title: "Develop the Balkans" 
 byzantium_balkans_desc: "With the Balkans under our benevolent rule, we must maximise the region's worth. Centuries of foreign incursions, barbarian destruction and insubordinate rabble have laid waste to a once proud and idyllic holding of Rome. We must reverse this appalling state of affairs."
 byzantium_serbia_title: "Conquer Serbia"
 byzantium_serbia_desc: "Almost a millennia ago, the so-called region of Serbia was once home to the proud Roman city of Sirmium, proclaimed one of the four capitals of our vast empire by our forefathers. It was lost, as was most of Illyricum, to Slavic settlers, depriving us and the lands of a vital trade network. With our resurgent strength, however, this region will surely recognise the supremacy of our rule and return to our fold."
 byzantium_illyrian_title: "Illyrian Advance"
 byzantium_illyrian_desc: "Illyria has not only been a place of vital military importance for the Empire, offering both bountiful manpower pools and valuable ports, but also a heart of culture and political significance. Many a ruler originated from the region and once upon a time, the province was as integrated into our administration and culture as Italia itself. To advance the Balkan frontier, reclaim the Adriatic and restore our might, Illyria must be ours."
 byzantium_danubian_title: "The Danubian Frontier"
 byzantium_danubian_desc: "Historically, the Danube River has served as a vital frontier against northern barbarian incursions. Trade outposts and civilian settlements dotted the banks of the river's length freely and safely. To reclaim the Danube is to reclaim one of our most formidable and worthy borders."
 byzantium_palestine_title: "Claim the Holy Land"
 byzantium_palestine_desc: "Antioch lays within our grasp. The gateway to Judea lays ajar at long last. A vital land, holy and ancient, deprived of us ever since the Bedouin horde swept through the Levant, now cries out for reclamation. Never again shall a son of Christ Jesus be persecuted for his righteous pilgrimage."
 byzantium_jerusalem_title: "Patriarchate of Jerusalem"
 byzantium_jerusalem_desc: "Centuries of heathen rule over the holy Jerusalem have reduced the city to a state of near ruin. Followers of the Pope have lost it time and time again, rebuilding only to see their pathetic efforts crushed by Saracen brutality. Only the might of Rome reborn may elevate Jerusalem's prestige and wealth to the rightful height it deserves."
 byzantium_egyptian_title: "Triumph for Egypt"
 byzantium_egyptian_desc: "Egypt was once a crown jewel in Eastern Rome's crown, comprising a vital second half to the majestic empire. The banks of the Nile have seen untold millennia of wealth and prosperity- and almost one thousand years can be attributed to Rome alone. We must reclaim the wealthy and ancient breadbasket of our former empire."
 byzantium_alexandria_title: "Patriarchate of Alexandria"
 byzantium_alexandria_desc: "Alexandria, as well as Byzantine Egypt as a whole, experienced significant heretic strife during our prior rule. To reawaken Egypt's slumbering Christian population and serve as a beacon of unity in a dishevelled and uncertain land, we must restore Alexandria as a beating heart of the church."
 byzantium_granary_title: "Granary of the Mediterranean"
 byzantium_granary_desc: "Egypt was once a bountiful granary for our empire. It fed our masses and fuelled our campaigns. When the Bedouin swept through the Sinai, the heresy-plagued banks of the Nile were easy pickings for the foul heathens. For our propserity, we must enrich the fertile region once more and instil an agricultural capacity unlike anything the world has ever seen."
 byzantium_landfall_title: "Landfall in Italy"
 byzantium_landfall_desc: "The pious and mighty Justinian the Great recaptured Italia in its entirety centuries ago- solidifying his name in history and proving to the world that one could make a Phoenix out of a so-called fallen empire. Tragedy and heathen treachery set us back tremendously and we have lost much since then- but so too shall we gain much more, in equal and greater measure. Italia will tremble before our landfall and the ancient Greek south of the peninsula shall return to our fold." 
 byzantium_tripolitania_title: "Seize Tripolitania"
 byzantium_tripolitania_desc: "Tripolitania was once an incredibly wealthy and secure holding of Rome. The great Septimus Severus even hailed from the lost Leptis Magna, whom upon his ascension, made of the city a marvel on par with Carthage and Alexandria. Reclaiming the region will seal off the Mediterranean from vile southern barbarians and also make safe the vital cities which dot the arid coast."
 byzantium_carthago_title: "Carthago Delenda Est"
 byzantium_carthago_desc: "The Byzantine state has had a troubled relationship with Carthage. Long ago, the filthy marauding Vandals established a petty kingdom out of the ancient city. Arabs have seized it and other vital Mediterranean holdings to further their slavery and barbarism. Today, the city stands in a horrifying state- a capital of piracy and slavery operated by none other than Muslims. We must obliterate this den of sin and evil in the name of our resurrection."
 byzantium_sultanate_title: "Dissolve the Sultanate"
 byzantium_sultanate_desc: "Out of the once-proud island of Sicily, a heartland of Greece in its own right, Muslims have established a sultanate. What's worse, they have trespassed upon Italia itself, encroaching upon the very city from which our forefathers came, our beloved Rome. This transgression and their persistent existence calls for their immediate and total annihilation- and Christ Jesus shall see it."
 byzantium_pentarchy_title: "Restore the Pentarchy"
 byzantium_pentarchy_desc: "Not since the days of a fully united empire, over a thousand years ago now, have the patriarchs flown the same banners up on their towers. Should we restore the sacred pentarchy, restoring each and every comprising city to their rightful faith and divinity, the heretic and heathen worlds shall quiver before the resurgent phoenix's holy flame." 
 byzantium_heal_schism_title: "Mend the Schism"
 byzantium_heal_schism_desc: "A petty dispute in old days long past shattered the Kingdom of God in two halves - that of the Catholic West and the Orthodox East, or so they are referred to. If we were to elevate the restored pentarchy to a height and honour undeniable to the Catholic West, the truly pious and faithful shall flock to the gates of not only our empire, but His rightful church - that which dwells in Rome, Alexandria, Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch and the heart of every holy preacher in Europe who knows our glory." 
 byzantium_march_rome_title: "March on Rome"
 byzantium_march_rome_desc: "'The Eternal City'. 'Caput Mundi'. 'City of God'. Rome has had many a name. As we march to take back the city, however, there are but four words that echo in the mind of every true son of Rome. 'Nostra Civitas'. Our city. 'Cor Nostrum'. Our heart."
 byzantium_isles_title: "Conquer the Isles"
 byzantium_isles_desc: "The assorted islands of Italia were once seen as backwaters, insignifcant and irrelevant to the empire. However, in our current situation and the new balance of power in the Mediterranean, the islands find themselves vital stepping stones. We must reclaim them to further our advance."
 byzantium_wmed_title: "Rule West Mediterranean"
 byzantium_wmed_desc: "The Balearic Islands have fallen to the Muslim stranglehold and find themselves contested bitterly between petty powers. If we were to wrest them from their filthy grasp, we would assert dominance over the waters of the Mediterranean's western half with ease."
 byzantium_iron_title: "Claim the Iron Crown"
 byzantium_iron_desc: "Northern Italia fancies itself a loose mess of independent imbeciles, deluded duchies and babbling buffoons, swimming in more undeserved wealth and squandered manpower than they know what to do with. Crushing this sad state of disunity by smothering the peninsula's remaining vestiges of power and sovereignity will signal to the world who the true masters of Italia are."
 byzantium_italy_title: "Triumph for Italy"
 byzantium_italy_desc: "For the first time in centuries, all of Italia lays at our feet, crying out for our dominance and reclamation. We must extend our power to the very limits of the peninsula and restore the glory of Rome proper across our former heartland."
 byzantium_berber_title: "Subjugate the Berbers"
 byzantium_berber_desc: "The entirety of our history in Africa has been plagued by the Berber threat. The local tribes have always been a thorn in our side, but clever manipulation and bargaining have done well to placate and swindle their masses. Now, however, they have organised themselves into silly sultanates- meaning we must march into the heat of the Maghreb to show them their true place."
 byzantium_barbary_title: "Control the Barbary Coast"
 byzantium_barbary_desc: "Not only have the Berbers deluded themselves into self-rule, but they have also laid waste to peaceful and idyllic Christian shorelines across the Mediterranean with barbaric pirate raids. If we were to fully dominate the coastline, we would cut the Berbers off from the sea for good- and all of Europe would surely benefit."
 byzantium_maghreb_title: "Triumph for Africa"
 byzantium_maghreb_desc: "Pockets of resistance remain across the Maghreb. We must crush these not only to proclaim our absolute dominance of Africa, but also enrich our coffers and economy with the luscious goods of the Berber mountain havens."
 byzantium_odyssey_title: "The Third Odyssey"
 byzantium_odyssey_desc: "With the Maghreb under our wing, we have acquired access to the Atlantic. Ancient thinkers and mappers alike spoke of strange lands beyond the Pillars of Hercules- now, in recent years, we have learned that a new world most certainly awaits us across the Atlantic, where we can send irritating foreign troublemakers, aspiring young conquerors and fearsome hardy homesteaders by the thousands to establish a new Rome. A new Odyssey awaits the bravest of Roman hearts."
 byzantium_andalusia_title: "Invade Andalusia"
 byzantium_andalusia_desc: "The proud land of Hispania has fallen to a foul Muslim horde. The humble Latin once spoken by the natives has almost been entirely eroded, save for the desperate northern enclaves. We must shatter the heathen hold over Hispania and deal a killing blow to the ailing Muslim rule to free the peninsula's people."
 byzantium_iberia_title: "Triumph for Iberia"
 byzantium_iberia_desc: "With the Muslims sorely wounded by our efforts, Hispania lays vulnerable to our advance. We must embrace the peninsula in its entirety and restore Roman rule across its war-torn valleys. The beaten and bloodied Christians of Hispania cry out for a unifier- and that unifier is Rome."
 byzantium_arelat_title: "Arelat Conquest"
 byzantium_arelat_desc: "The wealthy holdings of Eastern Gaul have found themselves in a state of squabbling for centuries now, fought over by the pretentious princes of Germania and the foolhardy Franks. Sweeping through these so-called independent powers will provide us a gateway to Gaul proper."
 byzantium_dethrone_title: "Overthrow the Carolingians"
 byzantium_dethrone_desc: "The prosperous and bountiful former province of Gaul is in no sorry state- the foundations our ancestors laid in this vital land have lasted, so it seemed, so well that the barbaric Franks and their petty descendents have thrived. The Carolingians as of late however have proven to be nothing but trouble for the humble peasants of the province and worse, even style themselves as Emperors of Rome. Let us snuff this pathetic assertation and remove this insipid dynasty from Gaul forever."
 byzantium_alpine_title: "March Across the Alps"
 byzantium_alpine_desc: "Helvetia, as the region encompassing the mighty Alps was once called, was a place as integral to Italia as Rome itself, many centuries ago. Not only did it serve as a vital defensive buffer, but also as a propserous and booming region in its own right under Pax Romana. Under our resurgent strength, the peasants and farmers of Helvetica may once more enjoy our benevolent rule and guidance- and more importantly, serve as a stepping stone into Germania."
 byzantium_rhine_title: "The Rhenish Border"
 byzantium_rhine_desc: "It cannot be denied- Germania is a wild, dangerous heartland of barbaric peoples. This truth is evident today more than ever. To guard against this formidable threat, we must re-establish Germania Inferior, a vital and historical defensive province and subsequently, an announcement to the divided Europa of our imminent supremacy."
 byzantium_restoration_title: "Imperial Restoration"
 byzantium_restoration_desc: "Roman rule collapsed swiftly in Britannia as the fall came upon us. The province prospered beneath and after our reign, however- that cannot be denied. The settled Germanic peoples have since utilised our infrastructure and guidance to fashion of Britannia splendid kingdoms and institutions. Today, we see a culture in vital need of new guidance and protection- and an estranged province in dire need of a most imperial restoration."
 byzantium_suez_title: "The Suez Canal"
 byzantium_suez_desc: "The merchants and seafarers of Egypt have come to us with an interesting proposal. If we were to carve through the dry, dire Suez a canal of gargantuan proportions, we could in theory create a canal linking the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, circumventing all of the deserts and jungles of Africa in one fell swoop. This would not only enrich our coffers, but give us a vital edge over our seafaring rivals- as well as announce to the world our taming and moulding of Tellus Mater herself." 
 byzantium_reform_imperial_army_title: "Reform the Imperial Army"
 byzantium_reform_imperial_army_desc: "While we have procured many a mighty general throughout our tired and ailing history fending off the heathens of the east, the imperial army leaves much to be desired in this brave new age. Europa's petty duchies and squabbling kingdoms have made of themselves fine martial educators and warriors with the wealth and prosperity they hoard. It is time we catch up and show to the world Rome's true capabilities and military might."
 byzantium_unrivaled_title: "The Unrivaled Phoenix"
 byzantium_unrivaled_desc: "The phoenix that is our reborn empire burns brighter than the sun. The world trembles before our power. Our coffers are the envy of Europa and the peace our provinces enjoy is unmatched. Let us make of our empire a fighting force the world has not yet seen- and cement Rome's name in history as unrivalled, unmatched and undefeated, forevermore. "

 rum_muslim_kaiser_desc: "The remaining Greek Romans continue to resist our rule. Do they not understand that destiny has changed the favors of their old Emperor? Just as they once discarded Jupiter for Jesus, they must now discard the false trinity for the mighty Allah, the lord of the universe who rules without equals!"

Perhaps they have a point. We'll think about it."
 rum_muslim_sophia_desc: "The church of Holy Wisdom, as named by emperor Ustinien, has fallen into disrepair since our conquest of Konstantinyye. While of the Ulema see an eyesore that should be torn down, our architects see the perfect foundation for a great mosque, and the ultimate symbol of our triumph over the infidel!"
 rum_muslim_janissary_desc: "In the Turkish realm, the highest honor that any heathen can have bestowed upon him is to be conscripted as a Janissary. These elite soldiers exclusively come from non-Muslim families who hold no land, ensuring their absolute loyalty to the Sultan alone, who makes of them his own sons."
 rum_muslim_pashas_desc: "As our sultanate grows, so too does the need for bureaucracy. We can't afford to invest too much of our resources into bureaucracy or else we might suffer from the underfunding of more meaningful bodies of the sultanate. Pashas - military governors - may be our solution to the bureaucracy problem. Let us create new pashas from our military men, and turn them into proper governors of our lands."
 rum_muslim_discipline_desc: "The Turkmen in our armies have always been rowdier and harder to control than our slave-soldiers. With the practice of slavery becoming increasingly frowned upon in the Muslim world, it would serve us well to discipline our own men so that they may fight with the same level of unity as other armies."

 rum_muslim_syria_desc: "The relations between the Nizzarids and Turks are a bit strained. Our northern border is a highly coveted land by them - yet, at times, pragmatism has to take precedence over old friendships. It’s necessary for us to take control over Syria and make use of its massive population as our newest cannon fodder."
 rum_muslim_baghdad_desc: "Baghdad is a city of great prestige, yet of little true value beyond that. It has switched hands numerous times and ever since the coming of the Mongols it has fallen into disrepair. To conquer Baghdad, one does not need a justification beyond that of returning the once prosperous city to what it once was."
 rum_muslim_house_desc: "The mere thought of what Baghdad was, and how it was desecrated by the Mongols, brings tears to any Muslim scholar. The very city that signified the existence of the Islamic Golden Age has fallen into disrepair. None of the scientific marvels survived the sacking. Everything that was glorious about the city north of the ancient Persian capital is gone...\n\nBut that does not mean we can't start a new Golden Age.\n\nThe city, though not glorious, boasts a sizable population. This allows for a source of local workers and manpower. We need to divert state funds towards rebuilding Baghdad into what it once was and are obligated to bring beauty and glory back to it. He who repairs Baghdad back to its former glory will go down in history as the one responsible for trying to bring back the Golden Age!"
 rum_muslim_palestine_desc: "Palestine shall be cleansed from the Crusader taint. One of our holy sites has been under infidel control for too long.

 rum_muslim_caliphate_desc: "The Abbasids may be too weak to assert control over Islam. They have lived for far too long in a gilded cage, dwelling within the halls of Cairo. For Islam to reclaim its golden age, it needs to be lead by a nation that is entering its own golden age.\n\nFor Islam to reclaim its golden age it needs to be lead by a strong nation, with a mighty military tradition.\n\nFor Islam to reclaim its golden age it needs to be lead by a nation of great virtue.\n\nFor Islam to reclaim its golden age, then, it needs to be lead by us.\n\nLet us proclaim the Rumi Caliphate!"
 rum_muslim_egypt_desc: "Our Sultan has but one word to describe the Nizzarids:\n\nPathethic.\n\nThey are only a bunch of writhing worms claiming to be a nation of greatness, while there is nothing great about them. They have lost Syria to us, and have been unable to reclaim the holy land while we were the first to succeed at it completely. They are unfit to rule over Egypt. From the Persians to Romans, the Caliphates to the Ayyubids, Egypt's fate has been sealed: they are only fit as subjects of a mighty empire."

If they don't, then we'll simply have them submit before the sword."

 rum_muslim_fate_desc: "The Ghazi Sultan is faced with a decision. Though we have always been righteous defenders of the faith, the status of the Dhimmi has become a subject of debate among the Ulema. Should we attempt to convert them to the true faith, or continue the longstanding Muslim tradition of Tolerance and special protection for the Dhimmi?"
 rum_muslim_sword_desc: "In order to cement our dedication to the defense of our faith, we shall pledge to all our brothers of true Islam that should any infidel encroach on them, we will come to their defense as a matter of principle. Combined with our consolidation of much of the Muslim world, other heretics and infidels will have no other choice but to take our Caliphate deadly seriously."

It is no doubt that the Nizzarids are preparing to make our territory into their next conquest.

 seljuk_kayfa_desc: "Hisn Kayfa. Oh, Hisn Kayfa, look at how low you have fallen. Once you were the humble giant of Islam, having pushed aside the Fatimids and Crusaders, but now you are merely the festering corpse of a bygone giant. We will put you out of your misery and under the turquoise shroud."
 seljuk_vassals_title: "Establish Tributaries"
 seljuk_vassals_desc: "We are a great Sultanate. And, as is customary for all great realms, we ought to have our own subjects. They do not need to give absolute submission to us, however. Lip service is enough to prove our supremacy over the other nations. We need to set up a system of tributaries to boast our glory and splendor over the Middle East."
 seljuk_baghdad_title: "March on Baghdad"
 seljuk_baghdad_desc: "Baghdad is a city of great prestige, yet of little true value beyond that. It has switched hands numerous times and ever since the coming of the Mongols it has fallen into disrepair. To conquer Baghdad, one does not need a justification beyond that of returning the once prosperous city to what it once was."
 seljuk_house_title: "The House of Wisdom"
 seljuk_house_desc: "The mere thought of what Baghdad was, and how it was desecrated by the Mongols, brings tears to any Muslim scholar. The very city that signified the existence of the Islamic Golden Age has fallen into disrepair. None of the scientific marvels survived the sacking. Everything that was glorious about the city north of the ancient Persian capital is gone...\n\nBut that does not mean we can't start a new Golden Age.\n\nThe city, though not glorious, boasts a sizable population. This allows for a source of local workers and manpower. We need to divert state funds towards rebuilding Baghdad into what it once was and are obligated to bring beauty and glory back to it. He who repairs Baghdad back to its former glory will go down in history as the one responsible for trying to bring back the Golden Age!"
 seljuk_basra_title: "Control Basra"
 seljuk_basra_desc: "Trade flows into the Persian Gulf, with Basra as one of its endpoints before it moves onto land. If we can take Basra for ourselves, we may well hope to see our trade and economy prosper in reaction."
 seljuk_saruk_title: "Defeat the Sarukhanids"
 seljuk_saruk_desc: "Misguided fools dare exist on our doorstep. They insult us with their blatant demon worship. We can NEVER be at rest if we have these infidels taunting us with their fire temples. We need to crush their temples and extinguish their flames, to prove that material fire is infinitely weaker than the loving grace of Allah."
 seljuk_georgia_title: "Conquer Georgia"
 seljuk_georgia_desc: "Georgia is a dangerous location, but not an unconquerable one. Throughout history, many campaigns that are waged in the region have been costly, but time and time again it has proved itself to be a natural border suitable for a great realm. It is only natural to want to secure our borders, and that requires but one thing from Georgia: Its conquest."
 seljuk_frontier_title: "The Eastern Frontier"
 seljuk_frontier_desc: "Azerbaijan is the final frontier standing between the Seljuks and the heartland of Iran. Once it is conquered, the floodgates for future, eastern expansions will be opened. The Azeris, though a foreign group, speak a language somewhat reminiscent of our own. It should make the occupation of the former Ilkhanate heartlands easier.\n\nLet us wait no more, then. Azerbaijan awaits!"
 seljuk_persia_title: "Invade Persia"
 seljuk_persia_desc: "As our horses pound their hooves into the Iranian soil, a gust of victory's wind fills the hearts of our men. Persia has always been a land of splendor and spoils, with riches awaiting all who successfully invade it. The promise of wealth shall motivate our soldiers towards climbing the mountain ranges, and battling in the thinnest paths. Iran shall be ours!"
 seljuk_pasha_title: "Assign Pashas"
 seljuk_pasha_desc: "As our sultanate grows, so too does the need for bureaucracy. We can't afford to invest too much of our resources into bureaucracy or else we might suffer from the underfunding of more meaningful bodies of the sultanate. Pashas - military governors - may be our solution to the bureaucracy problem. Let us create new pashas from our military men, and turn them into proper governors of our lands."
 seljuk_syria_title: "Thrust into Syria"
 seljuk_syria_desc: "The relations between the Nizzarids and Seljuks are a bit strained. Our northern border is a highly coveted land by them - yet, at times, pragmatism has to take precedence over old friendships. It’s necessary for us to take control over Syria and make use of its massive population as our newest cannon fodder."
 seljuk_palestine_title: "Liberate Palestine"
 seljuk_palestine_desc: "Palestine shall be cleansed from the Crusader taint. One of our holy sites has been under infidel control for too long. It is a duty of all Muslim nations to reclaim it and purify it of its Christian disease, and yet, so far, it would seem to be unfulfilled. It shall fall upon Seljuk hands to liberate Palestine from the darkness of the infidels."
 seljuk_cities_title: "Custodian of the Holy Cities"
 seljuk_cities_desc: "Second only to the Caliphate in worthiness is the Custodianship of the Holy Cities. It is the second most prestigious title any Muslim nation can hope to hold to itself. We should make the protection of the holy sites our duty."
 seljuk_gulf_title: "Secure the Gulf"
 seljuk_gulf_desc: "Basra was not the last port to fall under our control, nor was it enough to entirely sway trade under our heel. We need to extend our dominance over the Persian Gulf by making all of its Arabic coast part of our growing empire. It is the only way to fully dominate trade."
 seljuk_sands_title: "Sands of Arabia"
 seljuk_sands_desc: "Brave, free, and hard to control: these are some of the words one might use to describe the Bedouins of the Arab desert. They move where they please, which makes any subjugation of the tribes hard. Though it will be costly, we need to sway them onto our side - either diplomatically or through war. Then, once that is completed, all of Arabia is finally going to be united as in the days of the Islamic Golden Age."
 seljuk_egypt_title: "Overthrow the Nizzarids"
 seljuk_egypt_desc: "Our Sultan has but one word to describe the Nizzarids:\n\nPathethic.\n\nThey are only a bunch of writhing worms claiming to be a nation of greatness, while there is nothing great about them. They have lost Syria to us, and have been unable to reclaim the holy land while we were the first to succeed at it completely. They are unfit to rule over Egypt. From the Persians to Romans, the Caliphates to the Ayyubids, Egypt's fate has been sealed: they are only fit as subjects of a mighty empire."
 seljuk_caliphate_title: "Seljuk Caliphate"
 seljuk_caliphate_desc: "The Abbasids may be too weak to assert control over Islam. They have lived for far too long in a gilded cage, dwelling within the halls of Cairo. For Islam to reclaim its golden age, it needs to be lead by a nation that is entering its own golden age.\n\nFor Islam to reclaim its golden age it needs to be lead by a strong nation, with a mighty military tradition.\n\nFor Islam to reclaim its golden age it needs to be lead by a nation of great virtue.\n\nFor Islam to reclaim its golden age, then, it needs to be lead by us.\n\nLet us proclaim the Seljuk Caliphate!"
 seljuk_city_title: "City of the World's Desire"
 seljuk_city_desc: "If Constantinople is truly the City of the World's Desire, it would be wrong for it not to share its splendor with the rest of the world. It has hoarded its glory for far too long. It is, perhaps, a good time for the wealth and glory of Constantinople to be shared amongst the future owners of it: the Seljuk Turks."
 seljuk_nicaea_title: "Bulwark of Christianity"
 seljuk_nicaea_desc: "Is this the best Christendom has to offer? Pathetic. They hold nothing of importance, being but a roadstop before Constantinople. We should end its miserable existence and just get on with our conquest."
 seljuk_persepolis_title: "Sack Persepolis" 
 seljuk_persepolis_desc: "Persepolis has fallen, and yet it is still standing. That is not quite right and should be rectified. The last of the ancient, mighty capitals will soon enter the history books as merely another dead city!"
 seljuk_iran_title: "Reforge the Seljuk Empire"
 seljuk_iran_desc: "Centuries ago, our ancestors brought the mighty Mihranid Empire to its knees and the entirety of Eranshahr briefly fell under the Seljuk yoke. Now as the Ilkhanate has fallen and princes of Persia fight for control of Iran, it is time we march in and subjugate them once again, before they are able to recover their strength."
 seljuk_fate_title: "Fate of Persia"
 seljuk_fate_desc: "We have done it - Iran is no more an independent nation. It has finally fallen under the control of an Islamic realm. Its conversion to Islam is now inevitable. The Light of Allah has finally come to Iran.\n\nYet there remains one question, one puzzling question that we are not quite sure as to how we should answer:\n\nwhat should be done with the Iranian culture?"
 seljuk_khorasan_title: "Push into Khorasan"
 seljuk_khorasan_desc: "We have already pushed far deeper than any other Caliphate has, but that does not mean we should stop here. Instead we should push further east! Last time someone from the edge of Europe waged a path of war eastward, they went to the banks of India. If we ought to ensure our position in the Islamic history as the greatest Islamic realm we have to push even further, until we reach the Indus River ourselves.\n\nFirst, however, we need to conquer Khorasan from the middle. It won't be easy due to the plentiful mountain ranges, but it is still something we have to do."
 seljuk_kirthar_title: "Reach Kirthar"
 seljuk_kirthar_desc: "India is in our sight, yet it is not yet in our grasp. There are still a few dangerous mountains in the middle. Our armies are getting slowly exhausted and devastated from the delays in the mountains, but it will soon be repaid once we reach the lowlands and jungles of India. We have only to reach Kirthar now."
 seljuk_indian_trade_title: "Control Indian Trade"
 seljuk_indian_trade_desc: "We have done it! We have finally reached India. We are at the threshold of surpassing Alexander's conquests in the east. However, it would be foolish to care about conquest alone. India is a wealthy subcontinent, and we should put attention towards steering this wealth towards our heartlands in the west. We need to lay claims and control over the many central regions of India, if we wish to have a piece of the mercantile wealth that India has."

When our ancestors left the steppes of Asia for the various homelands, they found themselves in, they lost that connection with one another, and became separate and weak. Under the leadership of our glorious leader, we have managed to unite our people under a singular banner. No longer are we merely the Seljuk, a state ruled by a dynasty, nay, we are now a nation, a realm ruled for the people, for the state, and for the will of Allah!"

 seljuk_kashmir_desc: "With Khorasan consolidated, breaking into India is our next goal. If we can control the Khyber Pass, we will be able to make a swift descent into the plains of Hindustan."
 seljuk_ganges_desc: "The Ganges river valley is one of the most fertile and populated regions in the world. This open plain makes Mesopotamia seem a desert when compared to its abundance, richness, and the size of its cities."
 seljuk_sindh_desc: "Sindh is one of the only areas in India in which not only the aristocracy, but also the common people, are true believers. Their Islam will surely make assimilating the Sindhis into the empire far easier than that of any other people in the reigon."
 seljuk_westindia_desc: "Rajasthan, as it is called, is a land of epic battles and legendary warlords. This steppe-like region reminds our historians of the ancestral homeland of the Seljuks, in its climate, as well as the toughness of its people. No matter. They will be put to the sword all the same."
 seljuk_turan_north_desc: "Across the Caucasus mountains lies the Eurasian Steppe, the homeland of our people. In order to return from whence we came, we must first sweep aside the petty mountain kingdoms that block our path, as we did once before."
 seljuk_turan_horde_desc: "Since the collapse of the ancient Turkic Khaganate, many powers sought to dominate the steppe, but none were more successful than the Mongols, whose remnants remain some of the most powerful states even now. Among them is the Golden Horde, our fiercest rival, whose people will soon learn the treachery of their idolatry."
 selkuk_turan_asia_desc: "'Turan' is a word used by Turks throughout the world to describe the greater sphere of Turkish peoples. Never before could they have dreamed that one day, this fantasy state would become a reality - but under our Great Sultan we have shown that, by the grace of God, all things are possible."
 seljuk_devshirme_desc: "The Devshirme system has served us well, but conscription from dhimmi provinces exclusively has our fighting reserves running short. Perhaps it is time to begin conscripting young men of the true faith as well. The Ghazi Sultan would do well to have warriors of the faith in his host."
 seljuk_janissary_desc: "In the Seljuk realm, the highest honor that any heathen can have bestowed upon him is to be conscripted as a Janissary. These elite soldiers exclusively come from non-Muslim families who hold no land, ensuring their absolute loyalty to the Sultan alone, who makes of them his own sons."
 seljuk_sipahi_desc: "The importance of cavalry to our history cannot be understated. It was our elite cavalry archers that won us our new homeland at Manzikert. By creating elite cavalry regiments, we can instill with a charge of horses the same terror that we once struck into the heart of the Roman Emperor himself."
 seljuk_russian_subjects: "With the Golden Horde swept aside, in order to ensure a power vacuum does not arise in Russia we must restore the authority they once had over the Rus - but with ourselves at the helm instead."
 seljuk_tunisia_desc: "With Egypt consolidated, the lands of Tunisia are prime for conquest. Their trading cities will further increase the influence of the Sultanate over the Mediterranean."
 seljuk_maghreb_desc: "The lands of the Maghreb have been independent from the Abbasid Caliphate for centuries. With our new state established, we shall make them subjects of a Caliph once more."
 seljuk_andalusia_desc: "The last obstacle in the way of our restoration of Dar-al-Islam is the so called 'Caliphate' of Andalusia. The Umayyads have always been treacherous, and with righteousness on our side we will strike down these idolaters."
 seljuk_arab_tradition_desc: "With the Arabs making up an increasingly high percentage of our population, the aristocracy of the Sultanate have begun speaking a new language. 'Seljuk Turkish', as it is called, blends the traditional calligraphy and vernacular of Arabic with the mother tongue of the Sultan, creating ease of communication and a flourishing of literature."
 seljuk_bridging_desc: "With our borders expanding, we would do well to create a system of roads not unlike that which the Romans once paved, to foster the transport of goods and peoples throughout our lands."
 seljuk_caravan_desc: "Our homeland in the steppe was at a vital crossroads of the Silk Road; we, more than any other people, understand the importance of caravansaries to the speed and ease of trade."
 seljuk_sicily_desc: "The Sultanate of Sicily is a misguided polity whose traditions and practices are heretical. We shall teach them the word of God in its purest form, by way of the sword and the gun."
 seljuk_golden_desc: "Our Empire is experiencing a once-in-a-millennia period of Art and Culture. Perhaps the Sultan should formally proclaim a Golden Age to further inspire the people."
 seljuk_urbanize_desc: "The cities of Anatolia have fallen into disrepair after centuries of warfare and exchange between states. The fertile land of the peninsula will make it easy, however, for us to rebuild the once-great communities upon it."
 seljuk_industry_desc: "The fires of industry are roaring around the world. Production of goods is overtaking taxation as the primary source of income in most states. We must not lag behind in any regard."
 seljuk_faith_desc: "The Ghazi Sultan is faced with a decision. Though we have always been righteous defenders of the faith, the status of the Dhimmi has become a subject of debate among the Ulema. Should we attempt to convert them to the true faith, or continue the longstanding Muslim tradition of Tolerance and special protection for the Dhimmi?"
 seljuk_commemorate_desc: "Centuries ago the Ghazi Sultan Alp Arslan defeated the Romans at Manzikert, paving the way for Turkish control of Anatolia. This momentous occasion deserves a monument to its memory, and to the bravery of Alp Arslan and his men."
 seljuk_diwan_desc: "The supreme Diwan is the governing body of our state, but with the width of our holdings becoming increasingly unwieldy, it is apparent that we must reform our system of governance to accommodate greater lands more efficiently."
 seljuk_gunpowder_desc: "The Turkomans have always been pioneers of artillery fire, and their early adoption of gunpowder should serve as a model for our army's own artillery wing. Our cannons will be lighter, faster, and more powerful."
 seljuk_pride_desc: "The pride of our Sultan has always been our elite infantry units. These companies have been molded over time from the unorganized shock troops of nomadic Turkic armies into a highly disciplined force, the very model of modern military professionalism."
 seljuk_discipline_desc: "The Turkmen in our armies have always been rowdier and harder to control than our slave-soldiers. With the practice of slavery becoming increasingly frowned upon in the Muslim world, it would serve us well to discipline our own men so that they may fight with the same level of unity as other armies."

 geo_pass_title: "Fortify the Darial Gorge"
 geo_pass_desc: "Since time immemorial, the Darial Gorge has been a gateway for northern barbarian incursions. War after war has reduced the ancient fortifications of the Gates of Alan, rumoured to have been erected by Alexander of Macedon himself, to cluttered brickwork and dishevelled peasants. The defences are in dire need of revitalisation."
 geo_fortify_title: "Fortress Caucasia"
 geo_fortify_desc: "Our lands have time and time again been threatened by heathen expansion, barbaric wrath and the ill-gotten conquest of foreigners. More than ever, we must transform our docile peasantry's mountainous abodes into conscription centres and castle complexes. The bones of every foolhardy conqueror will be ground to dust against our hallowed peaks."
 geo_ciscaucasia_title: "Dominate North Caucasus"
 geo_ciscaucasia_desc: "The Alans had proven themselves time and time again to be incapable not only of defending and maintaining the word of Christ, but also protecting their own holdings. Furthermore, wild Cuman horsemen sit to our northeast, amassing numbers. To protect our interests, we must incorporate these untamed lands into our realm and establish a perimeter against greater threats."
 geo_ilkhanate_title: "Bane of the Ilkhan"
 geo_ilkhanate_desc: "The Ilkhanate, once proud and formidable, has been brought to its knees and reduced to a laughable enclave. Its perservering existence is an insult to the men of old who bled until death to ensure our independence. We must obliterate them while they are downtrodden and thus earn us a gateway to the lucrative Caspian Sea."
 geo_sarukhanids_title: "The Sarukhan Plague"
 geo_sarukhanids_desc: "Of all of our neighbours, the most foul of them all is not necessarily the most threatening. The Sarukhanids, as they go by, are an odd bundle of Seljuqs who have adopted Zoroaster's delusions and parade its subsequent horrors across Anatolia. Our first step in rectifying our sorry western frontier is bringing about their immediate extinction."
 geo_crimea_title: "Control Theodoro"
 geo_crimea_desc: "Under the strange proclamations, decrees and excesses of the Romans, Goths have crowded the peninsula of Crimea and founded an enclave prone towards idolatory, gleeful submission to barbaric interests and trade with the greedy and treasonous west. Not only is their existence a blight against Christ, but also an irritating sore crowding a point of strategic interest. Annexing them would earn us an upper-hand in the Sea of Speri."
 geo_trebizond_title: "Liberate Trebizond"
 geo_trebizond_desc: "The Greeks of Trebizond, steadfast and worthy followers of Christ, face brutal and scathing oppression beneath the Seljuqs, who proclaim themselves lords of Anatolia and a scourge of the righteous Lord's word. If we were to secure the Pontic Alps, not only would we free our brothers in faith, but so would we secure a foothold in Turkish Anatolia."
 geo_blacksea_title: "The Black Sea Trade"
 geo_blacksea_desc: "With the Sea of Speri secured, we must exploit our newfound influence to its fullest potential. For centuries, barbarians, heretics, Romans and worst of all, Italian traders, have greedily coveted the spoils of the so-called 'Black Sea'. We must establish mercantile domination."
 geo_overthrow_title: "Overthrow the Golden Horde"
 geo_overthrow_desc: "Our newfound northern dominions will fall swiftly if we do not ward off the pestilence which roams the northern steppe- the Golden Horde. We must shatter the Tatar grip over the region once and for all and drive them back into the accursed plains from which they came."
 geo_convert_title: "Baptize the Steppes"
 geo_convert_desc: "With our hold on the steppes secure, Christ's teachings must blossom under its expansive skies. To show the world who truly rules over these hard-earned territories, we must introduce our faith to the inhabitants and remove from them their wicked ways."
 geo_sarai_title: "Sack Sarai"
 geo_sarai_desc: "Sarai, sitting on the eastern side of the Akhtuba river, is the long-standing capitol of the Mongol foreigners and a den of heathen traders, false prophets and strange customs. To wreak upon it equal havoc and destruction its horse lords wrought upon the world is God's will. Sarai shall burn and the steppe shall tremble at the mention of our name."
 geo_caspian_title: "The Caspian Fleet"
 geo_caspian_desc: "The bountiful Caspian Sea must be tamed. With its shorelines secured, we would be foolish to not impose our cunning upon its blue horizon. Merchants promise us extravagant trade if we secure its potential, so we must act quickly and establish a Caspian fleet."
 geo_seljuk_title: "Seljuk Heartland"
 geo_seljuk_desc: "The Turks have foolishly settled and allowed their sheep to graze in a land not quite their own. We are willing to overlook this transgression should their overlords be slaughtered and relieved of their holdings.  We must route the Seljuqs once and for all and bring Anatolia back into the fold of Christ Jesus and, most importantly, Georgia."
 geo_roman_title: "Claim the Roman Throne"
 geo_roman_desc: "Time and time again, our ancestors lived through the same tale- Roman betrayal and subsequently, foreign conquest and exploitation. Time and time again, the Romans have promised wonders to us and thus used our young men as fodder against Saracen hordes. They cannot be trusted to safeguard their own borders, let alone Christendom. Let us claim Constantinople in an act of both righteous revenge and piety."
 geo_cilicia_title: "Safeguard Cilicia"
 geo_cilicia_desc: "The Armenians are another misguided, foolish sect of Christ who seek to twist the good word and make a mockery of it- yet, they are our persecuted brethren nonetheless and will make worthy subjects. Securing Cilicia will grant us a window upon the Mediterranean and a beacon for those oppressed in the Levant."
 geo_levantine_title: "Levantine Salvation"
 geo_levantine_desc: "For as long as the Levant is dominated by the Saracen, a dark cloud shall loom over the name of Christendom. To reclaim the heartlands of Christ is the ultimate salvation- and our rise to make this reclamation shall prove an everlasting testimony of tireless faith. The Levant must belong to us."
 geo_nicaea_title: "Conquer Nicaea"
 geo_nicaea_desc: "In yet another startling blunder, the Roman rump state has haemorrhaged all of Asia Minor to a rabble of angry Greeks. Though these Nicaeans may be brothers in faith, they boast worrisome potential in manpower, military prowess and martial ambitions. To safeguard Georgian Anatolia and earn us Asia Minor's riches, Nicaea must be incorporated into our realm."
 geo_beyliks_title: "Anatolian Hegemony"
 geo_beyliks_desc: "With the Seljuks dealt a crushing territorial blow, we must act now and establish superiority over the scattered, squabbling beyliks. Establishing ourselves as Anatolia’s new master is of paramount strategic and divine importance. We must remove the remaining beyliks from the map and claim Anatolia proper."
 geo_beacon_title: "Beacon of Christendom"
 geo_beacon_desc: "The city of Constantine lays within our grasp, the Bulgars have been humiliated and routed from their ill-gotten holdings and Greece has welcomed us with open arms. It is time to prove our piety and God-given righteousness to the world- to make of our realm a united paradise of Christendom."
 geo_greece_title: "Protect Greece"
 geo_greece_desc: "For centuries now, the Hellenic people have pledged subservience to the Roman crown. However, the Roman decline has allowed barbarians and worse, Latin marauders, to sweep through the Balkans, threatening the wealth of knowledge and devotion that is Greece. With our shared faith and similar circumstances, the Greeks should far prefer our generous protection as opposed to Bulgar vulgarity. Greece must belong to Georgia."
 geo_bulgaria_title: "Claim Bulgaria"
 geo_bulgaria_desc: "The Bulgars fancy themselves a new empire of the Balkans, seeking to exert their strange steppe tongue and suspicious zeal across the region. Truth be told, they would make far better cannon fodder and farmers than kings of Christ- especially when kneeling before our banners. With their heartland within our grasp, their spirit shall be crushed for good."
 geo_golden_title: "The Second Golden Age"
 geo_golden_desc: "The peasants were like nobles, the nobles like princes, and the princes like kings - so they said of us. Through our long lost golden age centuries ago, Georgia was a pinnacle of stability and freedom from not only unjust horror, but also heathen and Turkish oppression. In these times, the Romans themselves considered us a wise and fearsome power to lean on and our piety in pilgrimages was unmatched. Let us reclaim our honour and restore stability, improve our prestige and develop our lands to new heights."
 geo_agriculture_title: "Invest in the Agriculture"
 geo_agriculture_desc: "While trade is a vital necessity, we must bolster and strengthen our centres of agriculture. Our position, surrounded by marauding heathens and flagrant barbarism, calls for self-reliance and self-determination. We must improve our farmland until it is the envy of the region and famine becomes but a distant memory."
 geo_revive_title: "Revive Native Literature"
 geo_revive_desc: "Over the centuries, our people have perused three scripts of our own marvellous cultivation- Asomtavruli, Nuskhuri and Mkhedruli. Mkhedruli finds itself the script of the land, exempt and separate from the sancticity of church- and that is the script that we shall tout high, build upon and make widespread among our educated and noble elite. Throughout Caucasia, our tongue and writing must spread."
 geo_cities_title: "Cities of Georgia"
 geo_cities_desc: "Our positioning among arid, inhospitable and ruthless mountains grants us undeniable defensive superiority, but it must be confessed that as a result, our urban development is not what it should be. By pouring combined efforts of coin, commerce and blood into our cities, we may forge the beginnings of bustling metropolises."
 geo_gelati_title: "Rebuild Gelati"
 geo_gelati_desc: "In 1106 AD, our proud forefather King David the Builder erected the most holy Gelati; a beautiful, gilded monastery of Christ, serving as a centre of learning and science. Not only is it a place most holy, but a serene, vital crossroads for aspiring Georgian thinkers and theologians. During its height, people referred to its majestic sprawl as 'a new Hellas' - and we must make it one again."
 #Cumania

 cmn_defy_desc: "Once-proud Cumania has paid embarrassing lip-service to the Mongols for far too long. For centuries now, these unworthy invaders have horded land undeserving of their barbaric, disrespectful ways, lands which we cultivated and respected for generations before their arrival. Our revenge begins with insubordination- and insubordination begins now."
 cmn_sack_title: "Capture Sarai"
 cmn_sack_desc: "The hardest and most crucial victory lays right before our noses- the capture and destruction of Sarai. The foul city was erected by the dreadful Mongol Batu Khan as his riders swept through the steppe. To capture it and its adjacent plains will mark the beginning of the end of Mongol hegemony."
 cmn_legacy_title: "Legacy of the Steppe"
 cmn_legacy_desc: "Ever since the destruction of the mighty confederacy of old, our capability to field the great cavalry armies of our ancestors has been vastly diminished. With our resurgent strength and triumph over the Mongols, it is imperative that we reassert our superiority on horseback."
 cmn_coalition_title: "Anti-Mongol Coalition"
 cmn_coalition_desc: "Mongol strength over the steppe is waning. In the twilight of their hegemony, we would be fools not to find allies in fellow Mongol subjects and victims. All around the diminishing Mongol yoke, a vengeful thirst for blood grows- and we must foster and direct it."
 cmn_rule_steppe_title: "Restore Rule Over the Steppe"
 cmn_rule_steppe_desc: "With a crushing blow dealt to the Mongols, one of our crucial former holdings lays just beyond our grasp- the Pontic Steppe. These vital lands were once an oasis of tribute and facilitated fantastic trade with the Black Sea. Let us educate the current inhabitants of who their rightful rulers are."
 cmn_dismantle_title: "Bane of the Khan"
 cmn_dismantle_desc: "At long last, the dreaded Golden Horde has been fractured. Our true vengeance is at hand. To secure the steppe and protect Cumania forevermore, every province that dares fly a banner of the Golden Mongol Horde must burn and yield to Cumania, until they are mere soot on our soles."
 cmn_central_asia_title: "Cuman Restoration"
 cmn_central_asia_desc: "Our brave young riders and starry-eyed children have long been told tales of a time when Cumania stretched from the banks of Azov to the icy shores of the Irtysh. Now, their disbelief will make way for pride and triumph, as we reclaim that fateful eastern heartland. So too does the sun rise in the east- so too will Cumania rise once again."
 cmn_adopt_title: "Adopt Mongol Army Tactics"
 cmn_adopt_desc: "Though we hold contempt for our fallen enemies, we must pay respect where it is due- their ways were ferocious and their tenacity admirable. To enrich our own military knowledge and absorb the Tatar population of the steppe, we must learn Mongol wisdom so that their foul cruelty never sweeps Cumania again."
 cmn_alania_title: "Defeat the Alans"
 cmn_alania_desc: "The Alans have always been one of many little thorns in our feet. At the height of our power, they oftentimes recognised our might and either paid tribute or joined our armies. As of late, they lay in a similar desperate state to us and have devolved into conspiracy with the Georgians. They even dare eye our lands hungrily. We must strike first and put them in their place."
 cmn_army_title: "Recover Strength"
 cmn_army_desc: "We are surrounded on all sides by enemies. The Mongols mass in the north, the Alans hatch strange Christian plots in the west and the Georgians seek to establish an empire across the Caucasus. Let us rise to prominence and dissuade any who dare suppose we are weak."
 cmn_georgia_title: "Conquer Georgia"
 cmn_georgia_desc: "With the north of the Caucasus secured, we would be fools to ignore the threat laying beyond the mountain gates. The Georgians, zealous mountain Christians, pose a worthy threat from within their sturdy castles. Given some firm persuasion, however, we feel they could make excellent subjects."
 cmn_crimea_title: "Capture Crimea"
 cmn_crimea_desc: "Crimea was once a prized possession of Cumania. It granted us access to the vast Black Sea, a gateway to the strange Christian heartlands. If we were to reclaim this vital land and return it to the fold of our coastal khans, Cuman mercantile domination would surely make a return."
 cmn_qifjaq_title: "Trading City of Qifjaq"
 cmn_qifjaq_desc: "Qifjaq, not too long ago, was a vital city of Cumania. To this day, it remains a vital link between Europe and the Silk Road. Should we elevate the city to new heights, we could attract untold scores of merchants to its ports, thus restoring it as a fabulous and booming slave hub." 
 cmn_azov_title: "Seize Azov"
 cmn_azov_desc: "The city of Azov sits on the beating vein that is the Don River. Should we secure the city and the surrounding provinces, we could establish around the Don a perimeter against the Christian west- who find themselves worryingly unaware of the legend of Cumania and the might of the Cuman khans."
 cmn_ruthenia_title: "Invade Ruthenia"
 cmn_ruthenia_desc: "Ruthenia, as it is called, stands as a wealthy new prospective arm of Cumania. Its Christian inhabitants seem quite mortified by our presence, so we should best demonstrate the benefits of our rule and use them as a stepping stone for greater conquests into Europe's interior."
 cmn_yoke_title: "Cuman Yoke"
 cmn_yoke_desc: "Our ancestors, with ease, extracted tribute from our weak and ailing neighbours in exchange for mutual cooperation and respect. Many tribes of Cumania call for us to protect our neighbours, all the while extracting tribute like the days of old. If we were to spearhead a new array of permanent tributaries, Cumania would overflow with riches." 
 cmn_romania_title: "Subjugate the Romanians"
 cmn_romania_desc: "The Romanians, as they call themselves, hug the ancient foothills of the Carpathians, fancying themselves pious warriors of their strange god. Not only would they make fearsome and loyal warriors under our wise guidance, a subjugated Romania would also give way to interior Carpathia itself."
 cmn_bulgaria_title: "Destroy Bulgaria"
 cmn_bulgaria_desc: "The Bulgarians fancy themselves a new fledgling empire and a pinnacle of martial honour, forgetting our shared steppe heritage. Not only does a free Bulgar state pose a danger to Cumania, but so do the untamed Balkans, which, unchecked, are prone to fostering dangerous Christian rivals. This must be corrected."
 cmn_blood_title: "Blood of the Romans"
 cmn_blood_desc: "For as long as we can remember, the Romans have imposed their strange ways upon all within their grasp while cowardly flocking behind the walls of their cities. Now, they find themselves downtrodden. The city of the world's desire, Constantinople, isolate among fools, implores a worthy power to claim it- and that power is Cumania."
 cmn_carpathia_title: "Unite with the Magyars"
 cmn_carpathia_desc: "As the Mongols fell upon our heartland, our people, as well as many other steppe folk, fled across the world. Some became mercenaries. Some, like us, fled to the Caucasus. Others dashed west... and amidst the Carpathians, they sit lonely to this day, falling to Christian lies and pretenses. Let us bring them into our fold and restore our honour."

 feo_conquer_constantinople_title: "Conquer Constantinople"
 feo_conquer_constantinople_desc: "Constantinople is the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire and is known as the city of the world's desire. Furthermore it is a strategical location right across Anatolia. In order to strengthen our nation we must conquer it."
 feo_rival_roman_title: "Rival the Roman Navy"
 feo_rival_roman_desc: "The Romans are one of the chief rivals of our Gothic state, and in order to win against our rivals control over the Black Sea and various other regional oceas is vital to our survival. We must strengthen naval development and overshadow the Roman fleets."
 feo_bosphorus_title: "Control the Hellespont"
 feo_bosphorus_desc: "By seizing control of the Hellespont it will give us extra dominance over the Anatolian strait as well as opening a window for invasion into Greece, which would then lead us closer to the original path of our ancestors, who raided across the European coastline into Italy."
 feo_theodosia_title: "Port of Theodosia"
 feo_theodosia_desc: "As one of the longest surviving Gothic communities that was not completely assimilated into non-Germanic culture, the port of Theodosia must be developed and expanded upon to serve the ever increasing mercantile and military interests of our nation."
 feo_delta_title: "Rebuild Tanais"
 feo_delta_desc: "Right across the Black Sea from the city of Theodoro is the Greco-Roman settlement of Tanais. Now a shadow of its former self and under our control we should spend some fortune into rebuilding Tanais so that it may serve the Gothic people."
 feo_humiliate_title: "Humiliate the Khan"
 feo_humiliate_desc: "The Khanate has always been a thorn on our side. Once the dominant Mongol state in the region the tables have turned in our favour and we now hold the power to destroy the remaining khanate territories at will. Let us humiliate the Khan and demonstrate to him the traditional martial prowess of the Goths."
 feo_fleet_title: "Construct a Fleet"
 feo_fleet_desc: "While our ancestors might have marched across Europe on foot, times have changed. Modern warfare require not only expertise in land warfare but also naval warfare, and what would good expertise do if we do not have a fleet? It is time to build a grand Gothic fleet and to become a major naval power."
 feo_trebizond_title: "Establish Perateias"
 feo_trebizond_desc: "The Perateias are holdings of the Roman rump state of Trebizond not connected to their capital, we should seize the opportunity to conquer them."
 feo_ruthenia_title: "Invade Rus'"
 feo_ruthenia_desc: "As a rising power to the north of us, the Rus' must not be underestimated. A strong martial people should they grow too strong and unify into a strong Ruthenian state it will directly threaten the welbeing of the Gothic state. We must invade Rus' at this instant and subjugate them before they have a chance to unite."
 feo_restoration_title: "Gothic Restoration"
 feo_restoration_desc: "With our recent military victories we may proclaim the Gothic Restoration. Finally, after almost a thousand years since the fall of the last major Gothic kingdom, the Gothic people rose up from the ashes once more and are now ready to reclaim their lost glories. The power of the Germanic peoples is unstoppable, let all of Europe tremble and fear the Furor Teutonicus."
 feo_sarai_title: "Burn Sarai to Ash"
 feo_sarai_desc: "Sarai is one the major capitals of the Mongol hordes, and with our recent conquest of the region we shall now burn Sarai to ash and finally end our long struggle against the khans."
 feo_rus_title: "Heirs of Ruthenia"
 feo_rus_desc: "We have conquered the majority of Ruthenian lands and established hegemony over nearby states. While many Ruthenian states once proclaimed themselves to be the heirs of Ruthenia, there is no denial now that we are the heirs of Ruthenia since we subjugated the Rus'."
 feo_caucasia_title: "Safeguard Ciscaucasia"
 feo_caucasia_desc: "The lands of Northern Caucasus must be secured and be brought under Gothic control. As an important defense line against enemies on both sides due to the mountainous region, it would not be wise to let our enemies seize control of this region."
 feo_black_title: "Control the Black Sea"
 feo_black_desc: "The Black Sea is an important trade region and without control over the area we would lose a lot of precious trade profits. Therefore we must reinforce our navies and strengthen our control over the region."
 feo_terror_title: "Terror of the Tides"
 feo_terror_desc: "Our navy has grown so strong that many nations have began referring to our naval forces as the terror of the tides. It is a name that we bear with pride for it demonstrates the unquestioned naval superiority of the Gothic state."
 feo_poland_title: "Subjugate Poland"
 feo_poland_desc: "Poland is a gate to the rest of Europe, and if we are to achieve European domination we need to conquer Poland. Furthermore Poland is also a strong regional power therefore it would not be wise to wait for it to grow stronger, strong enough to threaten us."
 feo_pagan_title: "Pagan Fury"
 feo_pagan_desc: "The lands of Pomerania and its vicinity are lands of great fertility as well as locations of important trade ports in the Baltic region. Furthermore it is conveniently situated right next to Poland, which means that it would only be logical for us to conquer it."
 feo_carpathian_title: "Carpathian Intervention"
 feo_carpathian_desc: "The Carpathian lands are home to various warring peoples which greatly destabilises the region. We should take the opportunity to intervene in the Carpathian regions and bring it under our fold."
 feo_boii_title: "Land of the Boii"
 feo_boii_desc: "The land of the Boii lies right next to our Germanic homelands as well as the location of a famous European goldmine. Conquering this region would not only allow us to re-establish immediate contact with our Germanic brethren but also significantly boost our economy."
 feo_empire_title: "Invade the Empire"
 feo_empire_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire is nothing but a decentralised feudal mess. The Germanic peoples need a strong guiding hand not a federal feudal elective monarchy that is constantly at war with itself. This is enough reason for us the launch a massive invasion of the empire."
 feo_adriatic_title: "Access the Adriatic"
 feo_adriatic_desc: "By having access to the Adriatic we would come face to face with Italia, the ancient seat of the Empire of the Romans that fought against us so valiantly. A thousand years later we have returned to prepare for conquest."
 feo_italy_title: "Legacy of Theoderic"
 feo_italy_desc: "Theodoric the Great was a legendary Germanic leader and king of both the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths. He led his armies into Italy and carved out a kingdom for our people. We must follow his footsteps and reclaim the legacy of Theodoric."
 feo_imperium_title: "Imperium Gothorum"
 feo_imperium_desc: "We have conquered the home province of the Romans and established ourself as a European hegemonic power. It is now time to proclaim the Empire of the Goths to demonstrate that the empire in the west has been truly resurrected this time, for we are the inheritors of Rome."
 feo_francia_title: "Destroy Francia"
 feo_francia_desc: "As another major Germanic tribe, the Franks have been ancient enemies with us Goths. They were the ones who fought against us for domination over Southern Gallia and it was quite unforunate that we lost to the Franks. But now we have returned to exact our vengeance, the Franks will fall and we will destroy their kingdom."
 feo_iberia_title: "Visigothic Restoration"
 feo_iberia_desc: "The lands of Iberia constituted the majority of the once great Visigothic Kingdom until it fell to the Muslim invaders during the eighth century. We have avenged those who fought against the saracens all this time ago by reconquering Iberia and restoring the Visigothic royal title."

 glh_value_desc: "With our conversion to Islam, the scholars of the Muslim world that have flocked to our court have encouraged us to begin a campaign of conversion to bring the light of Allah to the many heathens of our realm. The non-Muslims who remain at court, however, have argued that they should be exempt from repressive conversion and have stated they are willing to adopt the status of Dhimmi.

 glh_sponsor_desc: "One of the greatest values in Islam is that of knowledge and learning.

As a prominent and newly converted Muslim state, it would reflect well upon us to sponsor our own Muslim scholar and dedicated ourselves to his teachings."

 glh_monastic_desc: "Temples are not necessarily required for Buddhist worship, though many monarchs spend much of the state's resources on constructing some of the most impressive temple complexes in the world.

 glh_westernize_desc: "For too long, our great ulus has appeared as a backwards state to the Europeans on our periphery. Their technological advancement has made them increasingly threatening over the centuries. Now that we are breaking into the world of European politics as a player and not a mere observer, we must ensure that we are taken seriously from a technological and scholarly perspective. We will embrace western military tactics and some aspects of their culture if it means we will have a seat at the table."
 glh_embrace_feudalism_desc: "The organization of our state has remained largely unchanged since the breakup of the Mongol Empire. Tribal leaders and clans still exert a significant amount of control over political affairs, and especially military operations. This decentralization cannot be allowed to continue if we want our nation to survive. It's time to truly get off the horse and establish a real government."
 glh_faith_question_desc: "The Golden Horde stands at the crossroads of many religions. To the east are the Orthodox Christians; to the north, the Islamic Volga Bulgars. Our own people are divided between devotees to the Buddha and followers of our ancient tradition venerating Tengri, the sky lord. Religious diversity among our population is fine, but with increasing tension within our leadership regarding our faith, it seems like the Khan will have to explicitly endorse one faith for the purpose of unity."
 glh_stabilize_desc: "The rebellious lords at the periphery of the Ulus have wrought destruction throughout our land. Despite their defeat, we must reestablish some kind of order among the remaining populations if we wish to pursue other endeavors."
 glh_caucasia_desc: "The Caucasus mountains have always been a natural border between steppe peoples and the Christian kingdoms to the south. No longer. We will make the perilous journey across the mountains to subjugate the Alans and Cumans so that we can clear the way towards consolidating the entire region."
 glh_crimea_desc: "The Crimean Khan's rebellious tendencies and the continued presence of the Gothic Principality of Theodoro have weakened our black sea presence. By reestablishing a hold over the Crimean peninsula and the surrounding steppe, we can project our power to distances only possible in the distant past."
 glh_reconciliation_desc: "Having long shaken off the Tatar yoke, the Ruthenian principalities are now divided and weak. Perhaps now, they will be more sympathetic to our interests, viewing us as a valuable potential ally rather than a threat."
 glh_integrate_ruthenians_desc: "The Ruthenians were largely autonomous during the first period in which we ruled over them. Now that we have reintegrated Ruthenia, we should invite them to participate more actively in our state, both politically and militarily. We have seen their cossack cavalry and are sure that they will make fine participants in our government and especially our army."
 glh_restore_kiev_desc: "Kiev has fallen into disrepair over the centuries. The once-great capital of Slavic culture has become a shadow of its former self. For the appeasement of the Ruthenians, we will spend the money to rebuild the city so that it may attain something approaching its previous glory."
 glh_rus_desc: "The remaining Slavs of eastern europe were some of the most resistant groups to the original Mongol conquest, some of them even managing to evade the Tatar yoke. These proud and independent princes will be subjugated before they even know our armies have crossed the Dnieper."
 glh_novgorod_desc: "The northernmost state of the Rus', Novgorod, was an afterthought to the Golden Horde hundreds of years ago - yet, with the other Russian princes subjugated, we see nothing else left in the region to conquer. We’ve been led to believe that White Sea trade is quite lucrative, and the city of Novgorod entices us with its potential for rich plunder indeed."
 glh_all_rus_desc: "With the last Rus' princes integrated into the state, it only follows that we should take the title that the Grand Prince of Kiev once held, and have [Root.Monarch.GetName] declare [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of all the Rus'."
 glh_finland_desc: "The Finns are low in population but rich in land area. Despite their native region having little economic value, its strategic utility should be taken into consideration. If we conquer Finland now, at least we won't have to do it in the dead of a harsh winter, with their fortifications properly prepared."
 glh_poland_desc: "Beyond our Ruthenian possessions lie the Poles. These religiously divided and fiercely independent tribes have continuously committed incursions at our border. The sons of Lech shall quickly learn that they are no match for the sons of Ghengis."
 glh_rome_desc: "The so-called Romans to our west are a meddlesome bunch of liars and scoundrels. What leg up do they have on us to carry such an air of superiority? Their power is shaky enough as it is. Perhaps it's time to teach them just how 'barbarous' we really are!"
 glh_sea_desc: "The Black Sea provides trading opportunities, but the merchants loyal to our state are threatened by the navies of Turks, Romans, and Bulgars alike. In order to protect their interests, we should construct a formidable fleet of our own."
 glh_yam_desc: "The road systems of our state were largely eroded or destroyed during our long period of decline. The ease of travel that our armies and envoys once enjoyed has become increasingly hard to come by. We should invest in our roads to reestablish the once-famous safety of travel across the former Mongol Empire."
 glh_state_desc: "Tartaria's young government has done relatively well for having been established so haphazardly, but our leader fears the possibility of rebellion in the future. By reforming and centralizing the government, we can establish a mutual trust between the crown and the provinces to ensure the stability of the realm."
 glh_baltic_desc: "The Baltic states have resisted Christian conversion and conquest in the past, but we are a new force altogether. More access to warm-water ports is always good, and the Baltic Sea has plenty of them."
 glh_sarai_desc: "Sarai has evolved over the centuries from a small encampment where the Golden Horde's Khan made his capital to a bustling metropolis. We will develop the city further, such that it may be mentioned in conversations alongside Cordoba, Khanbaliq, and Constantinople as being one of the world's greatest."
 glh_urbanize_desc: "The vast steppes that were once the geographic advantage of our ancestors now seem the perfect location for the construction of great cities. The open plains will be easy to transport building materials and migrants across so that we may easily raise our new urban centers."
 glh_asia_desc: "The many Mongol successor states of Central Asia are stuck in the past and chained to their traditions. They stand little chance against our advanced arms and the lands they hold will provide new frontiers for our people to settle."
 glh_tartaria_desc: "Having united the majority of the European and Central Asian regions of the former Mongol Empire, we have effectively brought together all the peoples of the steppe into a single, organized kingdom for the first time. Now, it is time to reach even further beyond, into the boundaries that only Ghengis Khan and his sons could reach."
 glh_motherland_desc: "Having conquered our way across Eurasia, we find ourselves face to face with the Great Yuan. Effectively our mother state, we cannot help but feel nostalgic when looking upon the open fields surrounding Karakorum. This land could be ours too, however, if we were to simply conquer it as well..."
 glh_ural_desc: "With the western Eurasian steppe consolidated, we find ourselves looking across the Ural mountains towards the remaining hordes that populate the eastern steppe. They're not exactly the most centralized of states, and their land is enticing to our settlers and armies. We will make war against our former brothers if it means advancing the needs of our people."

 glh_horde_sponsor_desc: "One of the greatest values in Islam is that of knowledge and learning. Many kings have sponsored religious scholars to live at their court and conduct their teachings and analysis of Islam for the realm to follow. As a prominent and newly converted Muslim state, it would reflect well upon us to sponsor our own Muslim scholar and dedicated ourselves to his teachings."

 glh_horde_teachings_budhda_desc: "The Buddhism we have become acquainted with, Vajrayana Buddhism, is very focused on the fact that one cannot achieve enlightenment through lone study, but through teachers and practice.

 glh_horde_monastic_desc: "Temples are not necessarily required for Buddhist worship, though many monarchs spend much of the state's resources on constructing some of the most impressive temple complexes in the world. They primarily serve as a place to inspire peace and purity, evoking imagery of the Buddha and primordial elements of the universe. With many new converts, it seems only fitting that we erect our own monumental temples to be renowned for the rest of time."

 tur_topple_angelids_desc: "The Angelids, much like their forefathers, have proven themselves unprofitable. They drown in eternal debt, bicker between one another like children and waste away under decadent autocrats. Worst of all - Constantinople, a vital heart of trade, languishes under them. Let us take it!"
 tur_fire_title: "Adopt the Greek Fire"
 tur_fire_desc: "The Romans of old had with them a marvelous naval technology - Greek fire. At their command, flames could leap across water itself to ensnare maritime foes, winning many a battle. Utilizing current naval intelligence, as well as the captured Roman archives, we could recreate this might - and with it, dominate the seas!"
 tur_albania_title: "Skanderbeg's Homeland"
 tur_albania_desc: "The mountainous abode of the Albanians is not only a fantastic nexus of Adriatic trade - it is also a vital defensive chokepoint. For decades, Venetians have been ground to dust against the hearty coastline by brave Albanian soldiers. If we were to employ the Albanians - by force, if we have to - they would surely become excellent fighters for our cause..."
 tur_defeat_bulgaria_title: "Defeat the Bulgars"
 tur_defeat_bulgaria_desc: "A great threat lurks to the north - Bulgaria. The Romans, in their weakness, saw fit to rely on diplomacy to deal with the malignant Slavs, converting them to their heathen ways and teaching them their high culture rather than doing away with them. What's done is done - we may as well take advantage. The Bulgars would make fine bodyguards on our trade routes!"
 tur_greece_title: "Control Greece"
 tur_greece_desc: "Greece is a hearth of philosophy and history, none can deny that. The only problem it has is its main demographic - the Greeks. Without ample administration, the region will never prosper. We must conquer it!"
 tur_balkans_title: "Subjugate the Balkans"
 tur_balkans_desc: "With the vulgar Bulgars, reeking Greeks and moaning Macedonians incorporated into our enterprise, the Balkan Peninsula at large quivers before us. Should we annex the provinces beyond our Balkan borders, we could fashion the region into a splendid manpower pool and announce to Eastern Europe our hegemony."
 tur_archipelago_title: "Secure the Aegean"
 tur_archipelago_desc: "The age-old Aegean is rife not only with spectacular ocean views, sprawling ocean ports, bountiful Greek markets and well-charted trade routes, but also defensive fortifications. To secure the Aegean is to secure access to the Golden Horn and, by extension, the Black Sea - earning ourselves a playground for our navy. Let the Aegean know only one word: profit!"
 tur_negotiate_title: "Negotiate with the Doge"
 tur_negotiate_desc: "For centuries, Latins have marauded through our territory. They erect silly little colonies, pathetic outposts, whimsical explorations into the far east - and as of late, even lay claim to Greece itself. The Venetian Doge, however, is a man like any other. Diplomacy, be it peaceful or aggressive, is an option. We must make it clear that we are the masters of commerce in Anatolia."
 tur_naval_title: "Naval Buildup"
 tur_naval_desc: "The Mediterranean is a vast and beautiful sea - but as sure as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, conflict rages across its tranquil waters. Pirates devour coastlines, crusaders pillage believers and Latins tout monstrous, delusional lies, such as their 'unmatched prices' and 'indestructible fleets'. Let us kill two birds with one stone - build up a navy to challenge these suppositions and lay claim to the Mediterranean."
 tur_corsairs_title: "Employ the Corsairs"
 tur_corsairs_desc: "Across the Western Mediterranean, fearsome pirates of the Barbary Coast make staggering profits. They seize unruly Christians from their petty coastal villages and sell them as slaves to the bustling marketplaces of North Africa and Egypt. These fine men could not only line our own pockets with new profits, but also make an excellent addition to our fleet!"
 tur_cyprus_title: "Seize Cyprus"
 tur_cyprus_desc: "Cyprus stands as a vital naval nexus off the coast of Syria. Crusaders and Latin traders alike have made it their home as of late, using it as a base to launch raids and mercantile plots. If we were to break the Christian stronghold, we could claim this island and use it for our own ends in the Levant."
 tur_delta_title: "Nile's Breadbasket"
 tur_delta_desc: "The Nile is a vital artery of Egypt. It feeds millions and though their lives are important - who else would work Egypt's vast fields and workshops, after all - the Nile could stand to benefit from becoming a little bit more... profit-driven, providing grain not only for the selfish mouths of Egypt, but also for buyers across the region at large. Namely, buyers who recognise our lovely prices!"
 tur_canal_title: "Build the Suez Canal"
 tur_canal_desc: "The engineers of our empire have come to us with an intriguing proposition. Should we cut through the useless sandy desert of the Sinai and bridge the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, we could feasibly create an artificial river - bypassing the entirety of Africa, a vast, untamed and unconquerable continent infamous for adding months, even years, to a merchant's journey to Asia. This canal could revolutionise sailing - and we could add a toll to every second of this revolution!"
 tur_companies_title: "Ottoman Far East Company"

In this new age of colonialism and exploi... I mean, global trade... we could surely set up depots in these alien lands and make trade so much more easier! Cheaper, too..."
 tur_levantine_title: "Levantine Trade Centers"
 tur_levantine_desc: "With the Levant under our control, the region stands to benefit from our mercantile mindset. The river systems of the Fertile Crescent, for instance, instead see themselves feeding peasants - providing drinking water for men, cows and plants alike. What folly! Let us rip these stupid farms up from their foundations and create fresh merchant ports and canals!"
 tur_blockade_title: "Blockade the Nizzarids"
 tur_blockade_desc: "Egypt is under the delusion that it is a self-governing body. Abbasids, Nizzarids, Crusaders... they are all the same - foolish conquerors, not true masters of the dunes, true profiteers of the endless riches of the Nile. Let us begin by showing Egypt who is the true master of the Mediterranean - then, their subservience will surely follow."
 tur_protect_company_title: "Protect the Company"
 tur_protect_company_desc: "Despite the vast coffers and bustling trade routes of Anatolia, the region is not without danger - and we are without a substantial military. Seljuks rage in the east, Greeks writhe to the west and Bulgars press down from the North, threatening our profi-... vulnerable subjects. We must amend our current weakness and make an army of our own!" 
 tur_nicaea_title: "Dismantle Nicaea"
 tur_nicaea_desc: "The Nicaean Greeks are a troublesome bunch. Having split from the Byzantines, they aspire to rule over Anatolia and more, touting a brutal military doctrine. This is quite frankly unprofitable - who is going to buy our wares if everyone is dead (or worse, Greek)? Let us put an end to this rump state."
 tur_turkmen_title: "Rein in the Beyliks"
 tur_turkmen_desc: "For centuries now, Anatolia has been ravaged by war. The Turkic migrations have seen prosperity and development come anew to the devastated region, but no singular Turkic force has managed to unite the squabbling people. We must remind the Turks of Anatolia who decides their taxes - for their good and for ours!"
 tur_anatolia_title: "Unite Anatolia"
 tur_anatolia_desc: "We stand as a major power of Anatolia - its riches flowing through our streets like rivers of gold. We must monopolise all of the region at long last, sweep aside all opposition and reduce our enemies until all that they can trade with are the decrepit bones of their own fallen!"
 tur_crimea_title: "Seize Crimea"
 tur_crimea_desc: "Crimea is a peninsula of major value. It offers access to the sprawling routes of the great steppe and stands as a vital nexus of naval exertion within the Black Sea. It seems over the past few centuries, it has been plagued with turmoil - Goths, Greeks, steppe peoples, Slavs and worst of all, Latins, have bickered over it. Let us step in and drink from the riches of the steppe."
 tur_black_sea_title: "Monopolize the Black Sea"
 tur_black_sea_desc: "With Crimea in our grasp, our strength over the Black Sea has multiplied tenfold - yet wily foreign traders, raiders and marauders continue to disrupt the safe travel of goods in and out of the area. With a bit of investment, naval protection and safeguarding, we could establish a monopoly over the sea once and for all and dominate its dealings wholly."
 tur_desire_title: "City of the World's Desire"
 tur_desire_desc: "In its current state, the city of Constantine causes us constant dismay. Surely after switching hands, being rescued from barbaric Greek rule, the city would have naturally prospered - but no. Investments must be made, marketplaces revamped, workshops extended... only then could we dare call our legendary capital the gateway to Asia and truly the City of the World's Desire."
 tur_network_title: "Expand the Trade Network"
 tur_network_desc: "Kostantiniyye beats like the heart of a raging bull. Its blood pumps through the veins of our company's newfound holdings. More must be done, however - marketplaces must be officialized, registered, monitored and revamped. No longer shall mere peasant stalls and crowded village squares line our empire - instead, trade depots to rival legend shall tower over all!"
 tur_hq_title: "Empire's Headquarters"
 tur_hq_desc: "Centuries ago, we established our Bazaar in the heart of Kostantiniyye - unwittingly laying the foundations of the empire we rule over today. While our borders have greatly expanded and our profits exploded beyond our wildest dreams, the Bazaar has remained the same - a humble antiquated centre of commerce, left behind by a changing world. No more! The Bazaar must reach new heights of splendour and efficacy!"
 tur_delight_title: "Turkish Delight"
 tur_delight_desc: "Our council has agreed upon a fantastical, whimsical, yet entirely plausible goal - should we eclipse the major powers of the world in matters of commerce, we could feasibly set a precedent unlike anything seen before. Traders of Europe, Asia, America and Africa would look up to us as the unequalled, unmatched, unshaken masters of world trade - and entrust us with their wares and coins alike. Truly a Turkish Delight!"
 tur_sicily_title: "Take Sicily"
 tur_sicily_desc: "Two things can be said of the Sicilians - though the Sicilians know Allah, they spit in his face by making a mockery of the prophet's teachings. Furthermore, though they know the house of Osman, they spit in its face by refusing to recognise the company's commercial supremacy. Enough is enough!" 
 tur_pacify_title: "Pacify Genoa"
 tur_pacify_desc: "Our domination inches closer and closer upon the Italian peninsula. The Genoans, once reckoning their heartland to be safe from our reach, now find us at their front door. Let us kick it down for good and declare the Western Mediterranean our playground - frightening the Genoese rabbit back into its hole once and for all!"
 tur_devshirme_title: "Devshirme System"
 tur_devshirme_desc: "An intriguing tradition has emerged in our officer ranks - the tradition of kidnapping petty infant heathens from their homes and sculpting them into model soldiers! This seems to be a good idea. Conscripts and mercenaries can often prove temperamental, unruly, undisciplined and most importantly, expensive - while a 'Janissary' army would always remain not only reliable, but the envy of the martial world!"
 tur_mercenaries_title: "Mercenary Armies"
 tur_mercenaries_desc: "Mercenaries can be temperamental, yes, but our reputation as confident and dependable employers has given us an edge over other powers. Mercenaries follow coin - and our coin is plentiful! If we were to strike a balance between maintaining a professional standing army and a permanent league of mercenary companies, our military efficiency would be unmatched." 
 tur_janissary_title: "Bolster the Janissaries"
 tur_janissary_desc: "The Janissaries have proven their worth - inspiring fear in the hearts of our enemies. With mercenaries to fall back on and balance out their horrible might, the Janissaries can now be bolstered to even greater heights. Fill up our army with these artists of violence until our neighbours tremble at their mere mention!"
 tur_african_title: "African Outposts"
 tur_african_desc: "While our supremacy naturally garners the respect of the Barbary pirates and their conscripts, establishing permanent bases along the Libyan Coastline could offer us a vast new pool of sailors - sailors not only willing, but daunting, ferocious and hearty!"
 tur_gates_title: "Secure Gibraltar"
 tur_gates_desc: "Our Mediterranean domination is threatened by one last complication - the opening to the west. From the vast Atlantic, marauding Christians make their way to spell our doom - and worst of all, the incompetent Andalusians have been more than willing to let these infidels have their way. We must claim the Straits of Gibraltar once and for all - spelling an end for Al-Andalus and Christian influence in the Mediterranean!"
 tur_marenostrum_title: "Denizimiz"
 tur_marenostrum_desc: "Our power across the Mediterranean is unmatched. These coastlines are our coastlines. These cities are our cities. These trade routes are our trade routes. This sea, as the Romans had it, is our sea. Let us proclaim it."
 tur_modernize_title: "Modernize the Production" 
 tur_modernize_desc: "Despite our hegemony over our home region, the productivity of our population lies in shambles. Peasants toil away for three hours or less before tossing aside their tools and lazing about. Ungrateful nobles line their pockets with profits intended for our coffers. Goods find themselves regularly seized and repurposed by the muddy hands responsible for making them. We must correct this trend - in turn not only centralising production, but multiplying it tenfold, forever!"
 tur_northern_trade_title: "Secure the Northern Trade"
 tur_northern_trade_desc: "The Romans in the distant past did well to negotiate with the unruly Slavs - converting them to their infidel ways, as well as teaching them commerce, coin and diplomacy. We too can teach them some new tricks - among them, that buying our wares and trusting us with their coin will get them into the kingdom of heaven! Fools..."

 tur_bogdanoff_desc: "Throughout the sprawl of the great white north runs a legendary name. Their goods are of untold splendour - so pure and so gilded they are said to be holy. They have a finger in every courtly pie - it is said that even the Carolingians bow down to them. Men quiver at the mere mention of their elite mercenary assassins - rumoured to boast dark magic, poison-tipped blades and the ability to rain comets upon foes.\n\nBogdanoff is the name. We must dare to encroach upon their territory in Novgorod and earn their respect if we hope to survive..."

 nrm_viking_legacy_title: "Legacy of the Vikings" 
 nrm_viking_legacy_desc: "The Normans are descendants of the viking raider Rollo, who swore fealty to the Franks after raizing the coast for years. The blend of French and Norseman cultures resulted in the combination of Viking Naval Supremacy and Frankish Land Tactics, creating the greatest combination of military prowess. Tapping into our viking roots and constructing a grand navy to cross the channel will surely help us claim our birthright of the Crown of England." 
 nrm_cross_title: "Cross the Channel" 
 nrm_cross_desc: "Years ago, our forefathers crossed the English Channel to press their claim to the throne, but the untimely death of William the Bastard at the battle of Hastings forced us back to Normandy; now, it is time for us to launch our second invasion, for surely this time we will succeed." 
 nrm_avenge_hastings_title: "Avenge Hastings" 
 nrm_avenge_hastings_desc: "Duke William the Bastard had a dream once, but that dream was crushed when his own men trampled him to death as they retreated. Hundreds of men died in that brave voyage, and for over 4 centuries, we have mourned their loss. Now, the shoe is on the other foot, and we will see to it that the English suffer the same pain as we did." 
 nrm_elite_replacement_title: "The Elite Replacement" 
 nrm_elite_replacement_desc: "Now that England is ours, we have to deal with the issue of the native English. For practical reasons, we can not replace the peasantry, for who else would work endlessly to grow crops and fight battles for us? But, the elite remain staunch that we should give them their estates and rights back. Obviously we should further strip them of their powers and ensure that our Norman elite get all the land." 
 nrm_duke_king_title: "Unite the Crowns" 
 nrm_duke_king_desc: "The Kingdom of England isn’t a true kingdom by definition, but rather a group of seven kings all united under one. This is a truely inefficient system, and it needs to be pulled out by the roots. Every heptarch’s land is to united under one crown, our Crown of England. No longer will the King of England have to serve the needs of other Kings!" 
 nrm_dual_title: "The Dual Monarchy" 
 nrm_dual_desc: "For centuries, the Franks and the English have fought wars over anything and everything. It would take a miracle for the two crowns to stop fighting, but our conquest of both Britain and France has changed this. Now, we shall formally unite the the two crowns of England and France as one, held by a singular King!" 
 nrm_consolidate_title: "Norman Army" 
 nrm_consolidate_desc: "The Norman army has roots in both the viking raiders of old, and the Knightly tactics of the Franks. Sadly, the state of our army has fallen into disregard over the past centuries due to the financial strain of crusading an entire continent away. We need to return to our roots and raise up a new and modern army for our cause." 
 nrm_breton_title: "End Breton Sovereignty" 
 nrm_breton_desc: "The Bretons to our west have always been our rival in France. Ever since the founding of the Normans, we have fought and bled for every inch of land. Their continued independence has become too much of a hassle for our growing empire, so it is time for the Bretons to be put down forever."

 nrm_paris_desc: "The center of the Frankish Empire is the capital city of Paris. The city stands as a symbol of arrogance and lavish frivolities of the court of the Franks. We need to strike the Franks at the source and seize their capital for ourselves. Without Paris, the entire illusion of Frankish hegemony will shatter." 
 nrm_francia_title: "Overshadow Francia" 
 nrm_francia_desc: "Francia has fallen from grace over the years, from the failed crusade in Iberia to the fall of Paris, the dying empire is truly on its last legs. We must continue the push into Francia and demonstrate our claim to the throne of France."

 nrm_thrones_desc: "While the Crown of England was our main goal for the British Isles, there are many other lands for us to conquer. The Scots, Welsh, and Irish all pose a threat to our overseas holdings, so we need to conquer them to crush all threats on the Isle. Britannia shall be ours!" 
 nrm_roman_title: "Roman de Rou" 
 nrm_roman_desc: "The Roman de Rou was a record of all the Dukes of Normandy written in the late 1170’s. It remains the pinnacle of Norman culture and literature, but it is outdated in both style and information. Embracing the renaissance thought in Italy, and adapting classical philosophy and art, we can create a new history to our people, and encourage thinking throughout the land." 
 nrm_castles_title: "Encastellation" 
 nrm_castles_desc: "The lands of England have no embraced feudalism in the traditional sense, and the homes of the English nobility are not fitting the standards of the Norman elites. Castles need to be constructed across the land to ensure that it remains firmly under our control." 
 nrm_architecture_title: "Norman Architecture" 
 nrm_architecture_desc: "The architecture of Normandy has always been adapting from the lands we conquered. With our conquest of France and England, we can create a blend of the cultures in building style. Our architecture will become a marvel of engineering that all of the world will envy!" 
 nrm_anjou_title: "Recover Anjou" 
 nrm_anjou_desc: "Anjou is the native heartland of our family, and its continual occupation by the Frankish Emperor has only tarnished our reputation as a capable state. When the Franks are distracted and weak, we will pounce and regain our former territory once and for all."

 nrm_reclaim_sicily_desc: "Sicily was once under the firm control of our Norman ancestors, but years of conflict has seen it fall under the control of the worst people possible, the Saracens. We shall set sail once again and reconquer the Isle of Sicily for Normans." 
 nrm_s_italy_title: "Control the Mezzogiorno" 
 nrm_s_italy_desc: "The Norman Kings of Sicily was our greatest accomplishment as a people, but the invasions of the Saracens and the vassalage to the Pope has lead to almost all remnants of Norman Sicily being wiped out. Southern Italy will be Norman again, and we will see to it." 
 nrm_african_title: "African Expansion" 
 nrm_african_desc: "The Berber raiders of North Africa have long been a pest to Southern Europe, and their persistence and tenacity is what last us Sicily in the first place. Seizing their homelands will ensure that we never lose Sicily again." 
 nrm_roman_throne_title: "Claim the Roman Throne" 
 nrm_roman_throne_desc: "The Normans have fought the Eastern Romans before, but they never truly pushed into Greece proper. Now, the city of Constantine is in our grasp, and the mantle of the Romans has fallen unto us. We are not only the Dukes of Normany, the King of Sicily, England, and France; we are the Emperor of Rome, and we shall restore the empire someday." 
 nrm_pope_title: "Solidify Papal Relations" 
 nrm_pope_desc: "The Pope and the Norman Dukes have always had a close relations. The Pope sanctioned William the Bastard’s Claim to England, and has always supported Norman interventions in Sicily. By further solidify this relationship and secure Papal support for all our future endeavors." 
 nrm_cyprus_title: "Stepping Stone" 
 nrm_cyprus_desc: "The island of Cyprus is the perfect strategic location for any operation in the Holy Land. It is safe from any army on the mainland, and allows its controller to invade the Levant at their leisure. Securing Cyprus will allow us to finally settle the score in Jerusalem and forever secure it as a Catholic city." 
 nrm_jerusalem_title: "Liberate the Holy Land" 
 nrm_jerusalem_desc: "We have finally done it, from our start in Normandy, the Crown of Jerusalem has been secured.

 nrm_introduce_feudalism_title: "Introduce Feudalism" 
 nrm_introduce_feudalism_desc: "The backwards Anglo-Saxon nobility never truly adopted feudalism; instead, they maintained the same institutions of their Germanic ancestors. The lack of castles is disgusting, and so is the peasants believing that they are not tied to the land. More land shall be granted to our nobles to ensure that the light of feudalism is brought to the dark lands of England." 
 nrm_cultural_title: "Cultural Assimilation" 
 nrm_cultural_desc: "Something is changing in England. The local English population have adopted many of our customs and the Norman nobility have adopted a few of their customs as well. The peasants have stopped calling themselves English in our capital. Instead, they call themselves Anglois." 
 nrm_london_title: "Expand Londres" 
 nrm_london_desc: "Londres, previously known as Lundenwic and Londinium before that, has become the new capital of our Kingdom. While not as developed or expansive as the old English capital in Hampshire, it has the potential to grow into one of the greatest cities in the world. One to rival that of Constantinople and Roma!" 
 nrm_tower_title: "Build the Tower" 
 nrm_tower_desc: "The local population doesn’t seem too keen on foreign kings ruling over them. They need to learn their place, and what better way to teach the uneducated masses than a prison to torture them? The newly constructed Tower of London will serve as a symbol of our superiority over the peasants and instill fear in their hearts as they walk by hearing the screams of traitors." 
 nrm_planned_title: "Planned Settlements" 
 nrm_planned_desc: "A crown sanctioned program to help settle England would do wonders for our economy. Lands need to be chartered and loyal peasants who love paying taxes need new homes. These new cities will become beacons of Anglois culture, creating a sense of pride and unity among our population. " 
 nrm_acts_union_title: "The Acts of Union" 
 nrm_acts_union_desc: "There are a lot of titles under our rule, England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and Normandy. It is becoming increasingly difficult to handle all these titles.

From henceforth, we shall be crowned as the Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, Ireland and Normandy; forever binding our crowns together!" 
 nrm_channel_title: "Control the Channel"

 nrm_rebuild_fleet_title: "Rebuild the Fleet" 
 nrm_rebuild_fleet_desc: "Ever since the second invasion of England ended, our fleet has fallen into disfavor due to the need of an army to constantly quell rebellions. But now, we have secured control of our new lands, and there are plenty of rivals who want to carve up our conquest. Luckily, England is on an island, which allows us to build a wooden wall to prevent any invaders from landing. Rebuilding and upgrading the invasion fleet into a defensive fleet is now our new top priority to secure our domination over the British Isles." 
 nrm_feudal_army_title: "Feudal Army" 
 nrm_feudal_army_desc: "The English never had the glory of feudalism, which resulted in the lack of knights in their military. This major flaw in their army should have resulted in their defeat in the first invasion, but they got lucky with the death of William the Bastard. We need to expand our knights ever further to bolster feudalism across England and encourage chivalry among the elites."

 nrm_discover_america_desc: "Just like the Vikings of yore, we must discover new lands for our people. There is a new world for us to explore, and our people are starting to get tired of being oppressed by our elite; sending them to this new world also solves that issue." 
 nrm_church_reforms_title: "Ecclesiastical Reforms"

 nrm_answer_title: "Answer the Reformation" 
 nrm_answer_desc: "Times are changing in Europe, a reformation is spreading like wildfire and the time has come for us to make a choice.

 nrm_wool_title: "Expand the Wool Industry" 
 nrm_wool_desc: "The rural lands of England allow for the rural herding lifestyle to prosper, and no herd is prospering as much as sheep. Wool can be traded to the Dutch or woven into clothing for our people.We are drowning in wool already, but there is more profit to be had if we just simply expand the industry to allow for more production." 
 nrm_cities_title: "Cities of Angleterre" 
 nrm_cities_desc: "Our initial settlements have been quite successful. The cities established by our settlement program have grown to become fully fledged cities filled with artisans, bureaucrats, soldiers, and even the homeless! We should further fund these cities so that even the smallest town in England rivals the largest city in Germany." 
 nrm_industrial_title: "The Industrial Revolution" 
 nrm_industrial_desc: "Coal is quite an abundant resource in England, and some clever scholars have found a way to utilize coal to increase production. The steam engine is a modern marvel, allowing machines to do the work of hundreds of men. Soon, all the world will be consuming English products." 
 nrm_workshop_title: "Workshop of the World" 
 nrm_workshop_desc: "We have done it; no nation on Earth is even remotely close to our level of industrial output. Across all our cities, millions of laborers work in factories to produce goods shipped all across the world!

 nrm_rail_title: "Introduce Railroads" 
 nrm_rail_desc: "With all this coal being used to fuel our factories, it is becoming almost impossible to meet the demands of the machines. Luckily, a couple genius inventors have found a way to make a cart power itself without a horse. This new engine is capable of transporting hundreds of times more coal than the horse drawn carts of yesteryear. The future of the entire world belongs to the newly named trains!" 
 nrm_universities_title: "Renovate Oxbridge" 
 nrm_universities_desc: "The universities of Oxford and Cambridge were Anglo-Saxon creations to help promote the spread of knowledge among their elite. Luckily, many of the scholars teaching there were happy to promote Norman ways of thinking in their teachers for only a small bribe. By expanding the universities even further, we can establish England as a center of learning and understanding." 
 nrm_royal_docks_title: "Royal Docks" 
 nrm_royal_docks_desc: "The Royal Navy needs more ships to help defend the shores of England. Fortunately, we have an abundance of coast that we can utilize. Constructing drydocks and harbors will increase our naval capacity astronomically." 
 nrm_dominate_caribbean_title: "Dominate the Caribbean" 
 nrm_dominate_caribbean_desc: "The Caribbean is an excellent region to farm goods such as sugar and cotton. Trade between ports has attracted pirates and privateers all across the world. The English do not have time for competition, we will kick them out and reap the profits for ourselves."

 nrm_colonize_australia_desc: "We have too many prisoners in our country; it turns out forcing people into the navy does not make them happy, and they always seem to try to escape. Fortunately, our explorers have found a land where we can send them, and such an inhospitable land will surely kill them. If they do somehow survive in such a place, then we have a new colony to tax as well."
 nrm_spice_trade_title: "Control the Spice Market" 
 nrm_spice_trade_desc: "Spice is the most valuable thing to an Anglois, as it not only adds flavor to our food, but it can also help us pass off rotten meat as fresh. The spice islands are unfortunately under the control of savages and rivals, but when has that ever stopped us before?" 
 nrm_cape_town_title: "Found the Cape Town" 
 nrm_cape_town_desc: "Africa is quite the bothersome continent for us, blocking us from the valuable Indian Ocean. Sadly, there is no choice but to go around. The good news is there happens to be a wonderful location for a colony that will grant us control over all trade flowing between the Atlantic and Indian Ocean." 
 nrm_triangle_trade_title: "The Triangle Trade"
 nrm_triangle_trade_desc: "A cycle has begun between our colonies, soldiers and weapons are being sent from Europe to the Caribbean, raw materials from the Caribbean are sent to North America, and manufactured goods are sent from North America to Europe. This system has been quite beneficial to our economy, but with all things, it can be further expanded to maximize profits."

 wls_po_valley_title: "Strike Into the Po Valley"
 wls_po_valley_desc: "In ancient times, Celts known as the Insubres inhabited the lush marshes of the Po Valley. It was said that the fabled city of Milan, the jewel of Lombardy, was founded by their earnest hands and proclaimed their capital. Just like our forefathers in Prydain, however, their reign did not last - for invaders, namely the Romans, ousted and spat upon them. Given our current track record - and a successful track record at that - of reclaiming lost, rightful Celtic land, the Po Valley is ripe for the taking."
 wls_rome_title: "Reclaim Rhufain"
 wls_rome_desc: "Insubria has been reclaimed. More work is left to do, however - namely, Central Italy. Our philosophers, historians, nobles and clergy have stood invariably united, or at least earnest, in regards to the idea of Celtic restoration - but in recent years, a new idea has become dominant, almost replacing the original Celtic dream. In a final act of vengeance against Europe, we now seek to claim the mantle of Rome itself - and make all of Italy a holding of the Celts, now and forever, starting with the ancient city of Rhufain and its adjacent provinces."
 wls_rhineland_title: "Secure the Rhineland"
 wls_rhineland_desc: "The Rhineland - the ancient divide between the Celtic and Germanic worlds - finds itself reduced to a babbling, tattered mess of foolish German lords and monks. The likes of the mighty Treveri of old would shudder to hear the German tongue uttered so boldly on the banks of the Rhine! In the name of their lost honour and culture, we shall reclaim the Rhineland, restoring the ancient border of the Celtic world."
 wls_germany_title: "Push Into Yr Almaen"
 wls_germany_desc: "Roman and Greek scholars alike theorised that our ancient heartland lays in the lands of Yr Almaen - the idyllic pastures, hills and mountains north of the Alps. Thousands of years ago, our brave forefathers struck out from the region, settling Gaul, Prydain and more. Let us return to this lost homeland, restore Celtic dominance and drive back our eternal Germanic rivals."
 wls_hre_title: "Destroy the False Empire"
 wls_hre_desc: "Rome itself was a false and unworthy empire, having succeeded through sly cunning, trickery, dishonourable diplomacy and fiendish lies. Something far worse has taken its place however, limited mainly to the lands east of the Rhine. Despite its claims to the contrary,  it is clearly not quite Holy, not quite Roman and not quite an Empire. Some say it would be best to let this pitiful beast continue to fumble and stumble, standing as an example of German ineptitude, but the decentralised empire's unpredictable  tendency towards coalitions and sporadic bursts of unity make it a danger to Prydain. Let us shatter its spirit forever."
 wls_union_ireland_title: "Union With the Irish"
 wls_union_ireland_desc: "With a foothold in Ireland established, it is appropriate that we integrate the island fully. Our lords stand eager to carve up the remaining Irish property and have already invested a great deal in their private security forces, bolstered fortifications and local integration efforts. Should we aid them, Ireland could prove to be a new arm of Prydain proper and offer a deep pool of manpower."
 wls_ostmark_title: "Take Carnuntum"
 wls_ostmark_desc: "Carnuntum, an eastern extension of the Celtic heartland, would serve as a valuable frontier. Its harsh mountains, winding rivers and geopolitical importance would provide our army now and forever a springboard with which to sharpen our infantry's readiness and hardiness against the grinding barbarians of the east."
 wls_moors_title: "Defeat the Moors"
 wls_moors_desc: "Iberia, once a heartland of the Celtic world, has been ravaged by war. Not only have countless conflicts reduced its once-fertile valleys and grasslands to arid, hellish wastes, but so have the former Celtic populations been brushed aside. If we were to strike a blow to the peninsula's dominant Muslim power and secure a foothold in the northern mountains, we could not only embolden our forces and announce a Celtic return to Iberia, but also signal to all of Europe an end to the leering Muslim hegemony."
 wls_conversion_title: "Complete the Conversion"
 wls_conversion_desc: "The brutal battle of Valencia stands avenged. Christians all over Europe marvel at our achievement. Now, with the peninsula secured, sheltered beneath the wing of the Lord once more, the true faith may be restored to the valleys of Iberia. For it is written - 'He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.'"
 wls_sitaly_title: "Liberate South Italy"
 wls_sitaly_desc: "A horror has befallen Italy's south. Much like Iberia, it has been claimed by Muslim ravagers, whom have entrenched the narrow peninsula with their ways and faith. Two can play at that game. The Celtic world is always in need of new holdings; if the foul sultanate were to fall to our might, the oppressed and tarnished inhabitants would flock to our banners and the true faith, eager to be accepted."
 wls_pacify_title: "Pacify the French"
 wls_pacify_desc: "Gallia, freshly liberated, is restless. The populace is thoroughly Latin, having lost its Celtic identity, but with steady, consistent pacification efforts, we may soon see loyalty and cooperation."
 wls_breton_title: "The Breton Renaissance"
 wls_breton_desc: "The Bretons are a distant cousins to the Welsh, the last remnants of the Celtic peoples that lived in the mainland prior to the Latin and Germanic invasions. We must revitalize these people and spread their language and customs across Gallia once more!"

 ab_eng_wales_title: "Subjugate Wales"
 ab_eng_wales_desc: "The March of Wales was established by the Godwin dynasty to slowly integrate the Welsh into our growing kingdom, but a peasant rebellion broke out in Wales after the death of Edgar the Atheling in 1126 AD. Afterwards, the Cyning’s army suffered a devastating defeat at the battle of Harlech, which resulted in the entire march breaking away. It is time to rectify these wrongs and reestablish the Welsh March once again."
 ab_eng_cornwall_title: "Reclaim Cornwall" 
 ab_eng_cornwall_desc: "During the first Ænglish anarchy in 1126, the Cornish Duke rebelled and occupied Devon. The constant turmoil and infighting between Heptarchs has distracted our previous rulers from restoring order in the south, but it is time to remedy this. We will reconquer our lands and make the Cornish pay for their treachery."
 ab_eng_fyrd_title: "Cyning's Fyrd" 
 ab_eng_fyrd_desc: "The Ænglish army hasn’t always been the most unified force. Local levies from the Heptarchs and various nobles make up the majority of our armed forces. To further distance ourselves from relying on levies from questionably loyal vassals, we will establish the Royal Army. A loyal and effective fighting force that answers to the Cyning and Cyning only. This will not only strengthen our position on the isles, but also weaken malicious forces inside the realm as well."
 ab_eng_hull_title: "End the Danelaw" 
 ab_eng_hull_desc: "The heathen Danes have occupied Hull since the Heptarch Wars, and while a united front was formed to repel the invaders, the advance has stagnated into a stalemate between the Danish raiders and our loyal Ænglish soldiers. To ensure our domination of the isles, we must reclaim Hull and kick the Danes out of Ængland proper for good."
 ab_eng_haestingas_title: "Remember Haestingas" 
 ab_eng_haestingas_desc: "While we may have defeated the Normans and killed their bastard Duke William back in the battle of Haestingas, they still lay claim to our throne to this day. The King of Francia has attempted to enforce their claim before, and if we are not careful, they might attempt to do so again. We will conquer the Duchy of Normandy and avenge those who lost their life in Haestingas - nevermore will the Ænglish have to worry about a Norman Yoke."
 ab_eng_albion_title: "Cynerice Brytenlond" 
 ab_eng_albion_desc: "After many years of conquest, bloodshed, and scheming, we have finally united the British Isles under one banner. With the Crowns of Ængland, Scotland, Ireland and Wales all under our control, it is time to crown ourselves the kings of Britannia and Ireland. Together our United Kingdom shall rule the waves and dominate the world!"
 ab_eng_scotland_title: "Cross Hadrian's Wall" 
 ab_eng_scotland_desc: "Hadrian’s Wall was constructed by Roman Emperor Hadrian back in 122 AD to keep the northern Picts out of Roman Ængland. Ever since the northern marches fell to the King of Scots during the anarchy of 1126, Hadrian’s Wall has been used to keep the Scots from encroaching further into Ænglish Lands. It is time to reconquer the northern march and establish a buffer between us and the Scots."
 ab_eng_ireland_title: "Laudable Conquest" 
 ab_eng_ireland_desc: "While we were busy dealing with the Danish invasion in York, our marches in Ireland were toppled by the Gaelic lords. With the immediate threat of the Danes dealt with, we must turn our attention back to Ireland and reconquer our lost lands."
 ab_eng_high_king_title: "High King of Ireland" 
 ab_eng_high_king_desc: "Ireland has always been a contested region between the numerous Ruireichs that make up the Island. We must put an end to all the petty disputes and conquer the Emerald Isle for ourselves. The High Kingdom will belong to Ængland and Ængland alone."
 ab_eng_north_sea_title: "Rule the North Sea" 
 ab_eng_north_sea_desc: "The North Sea has always been ruled by the Viking invaders. They cross from Scandinavia and dominate nearly every aspect of the north coast. It is time to turn the tables on the Vikings and overthrow their monopoly in the North Sea. No longer will every coastal village in Ængland have to fear a possible Viking raid; now, the Vikings will fear us."
 ab_eng_danish_title: "Rival the Danish Navy" 
 ab_eng_danish_desc: "The only true external threat to the British Isles is the Viking raiders across the North Sea. For over 50 years, we have fought a slow and brutal battle to reclaim York from the Danes. To ensure that they can not raid our coast or reinforce their armies, it is necessary for us to construct the mightiest fleet the North Sea has ever seen."
 ab_eng_jutland_title: "Landfall in Scandinavia" 
 ab_eng_jutland_desc: "The next logical step towards fighting off the Viking raiders is to take the fight to their homeland. By landing and occupying Jutland, we will cripple any Danish attempt to reinvade the British Isles. First Jutland, then Scandinavia!"
 ab_eng_stamford_title: "Legacy of Stamfordbrycge" 
 ab_eng_stamford_desc: "Hundreds of years ago, our legendary Cyning defeated the Norwegian King Harald Hardrada at the battle of Stamfordbrycge. The complete rout of the Norwegian army should have been the end of the Viking age, but infighting between Heptarchs and the Cyning has allowed the Vikings to once again pillage the coast. Today, however, we have landed and struck a fatal blow against the Norwegians by occupying the ancient home of Harald Hardrada. This resounding success will shatter the resolve of the heathen armies."
 ab_eng_sound_toll_title: "Control the Sound Toll" 
 ab_eng_sound_toll_desc: "The Sound Toll sits as one of the most profitable institutions in the Baltic Sea. The ability to toll any merchant ship that passes through would be extremely beneficial to our economy. Let us occupy the Danish Heartlands of København and take over this institution. With complete control of the Sound Toll, we will be able to push further into the Baltic sea and destroy the Norse menace."
 ab_eng_hansa_title: "Hanseatic Heartland" 
 ab_eng_hansa_desc: "The Hanseatic League is one of the richest trade leagues in all of Europe. With ports all across Europe belonging to it. From London to Neva, From Aachen to Danzig, the size and power of this league is impressive. Seizing the center of the league and taking over their trade routes would ensure Ænglish trade domination of not just the Baltic, but all of Europe."
 ab_eng_pagan_title: "Dismantle the Pagan Realms" 
 ab_eng_pagan_desc: "After so long, we have finally avenged all those who have lost their lives to the Viking raids. Ever since the first raid in 793 AD, the Isles have known nothing but fear and turmoil, but now we have fully conquered all the Norse lands, and with this victory, we will never let another Viking desecrate our shores. God Save Ængland!"
 ab_eng_highlands_title: "Storm the Highlands" 
 ab_eng_highlands_desc: "The Highlands of Scotland are home to the most resilient clans on the whole Island. They have resisted every effort from foreign invaders to conquer their lands. Subjugating them will not be an easy task, but doing so would be a groundbreaking achievement and truly establish Ængland as the foremost power on the Isles."
 ab_eng_acts_title: "The Acts of Union" 
 ab_eng_acts_desc: "The Crown of Scotland has always been a thorn in our side, from constant fighting and underhanded dealings with rebellious Heptarchs, they have made it their goal to weaken Ænglish authority on the Isles, but perhaps we can come to terms with the Scots. By formally uniting the Crown of Ængland with the Crown of Scotland, we can create a sense of Unity between Ænglish and Scots, and maybe they will learn to accept and love us. We can only hope."
 ab_eng_isles_title: "Liberate the Isles" 
 ab_eng_isles_desc: "The Norwegian raiders have unjustly occupied various Isles around Britain for over a century. Viking raids are frequently conducted from these isles and many hostages are held on and extorted from them. By conquering these Isles back from the Norwegians, we can secure a safer coast for all of Britain, but more importantly Ængland."
 ab_eng_fate_title: "Fate of the Irish" 
 ab_eng_fate_desc: "The Irish don’t seem too keen on being subjects of the Cynnig. Constant rebellions, refusal to pay taxes, and a disregard for Ænglish law has become quite common on the Emerald Isle. While we could always do it the old fashioned way and force the Irish to respect the law, we could also grant them some autonomy, allowing them to keep local laws in place and pay limited taxes. Either way, we will have to deal with them before the whole Isle revolts."
 ab_eng_dutch_title: "Rival the Dutch" 
 ab_eng_dutch_desc: "The Dutch remain the only real threat to Ænglish control in the channel. By investing more into the Channel, we can overtake the Dutch completely, allowing us to drain their coffers dry through trade, opening them up to a naval invasion."
 ab_eng_holland_title: "Invade Holland" 
 ab_eng_holland_desc: "The area around Holland contains some of the most prosperous and populous cities in all of Europe. Conquering Amsterdam and surrounding cities will not only allow us to establish a new landing site in Europe, but also grant us access to the Rhine, the gateway to inland Germany."
 ab_eng_lowlands_title: "Control the Low Countries" 
 ab_eng_lowlands_desc: "The lowlands are highly coveted lands by all their neighbors. From the Lotharingians to Franks to upstart Germans, everyone wants a piece. It is only natural for us to want the Lowlands as well. By conquering the Lowlands, we can also unite the staple port of Calais with our newly conquered lands."
 ab_eng_channel_title: "Dominate the Channel" 
 ab_eng_channel_desc: "The Ænglish channel is slowly becoming the most important trade center in the world. With trade flowing from the Baltic, France, Germany, and the new world, there is a major incentive to ensure complete Ænglish domination of the channel. Complete dominance of the channel will help expand our empire to hegemonic status across the globe."
 ab_eng_german_title: "German Alliances" 
 ab_eng_german_desc: "An old piece of wisdom says that ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend,’ and that wisdom perfectly reflects our situation with our eternal rivals in Francia. The German minors that dot the Holy Roman Empire also oppose any Frankish encroachment on their rights. Therefore it is necessary for us to align them towards ourselves to help stave off any Frankish aggression in the region."
 ab_eng_roman_title: "Imperator Romanorum"
 ab_eng_roman_desc: "The most prestigious title in all of Europe is that of Holy Roman Emperor, and with our meteoric rise as a great power, it is fitting for the Ænglish Cyning to take over this position. We shall lead the empire into a new golden age and establish a true European superpower lead by the Ænglish!"

 ab_eng_portsmouth_desc: "The royal dockyards of Portesmutha have become a crucial part of our maritime supremacy. Almost all trade and information comes through this one port. By expanding it further, we can turn Portesmutha into the trade center of the world!"
 ab_eng_reinforce_title: "Reinforce the Coastline" 
 ab_eng_reinforce_desc: "The biggest threat to Ængland does not come from the Isles, but rather across the North Sea or Ænglish Channel. The Franks and Vikings wish for nothing more than to destroy our culture. Coastal fortifications will make it impossible for them to properly threaten the Ænglish heartland." 
 ab_eng_admiralty_title: "The British Admiralty" 
 ab_eng_admiralty_desc: "Generals in history have always received more credit than admirals. Everyone remembers the likes of Caesar and Hannibal, but no one seems to remember Lucullus and his key victories against the Carthaginians. However in Britain, we respect our admirals more than any other nation. They are the first line of defense for our nation, and as such, they need proper training to ensure our continued naval supremacy. The finest admirals in all of the world will come from our new admiralties."

 ab_eng_modernize_desc: "The average soldier struggles to survive on the high seas, and the average ship just does not accommodate the average soldier. It is time to rebuild the fleet from the ground up. Modern Ships designed to house not just any soldiers, but the royal marines. An elite fighting force conditioned for sailing on the seas. All our enemies will run in fear at the sight of our new navy and marines." 
 ab_eng_rule_title: "Rule the Waves" 
 ab_eng_rule_desc: "It is now an undisputed fact that the British navy rules the waves. From the North Sea to the South China Sea, no one shall contest us. Our success only breeds more success. We shall build better and stronger, no one will ever be allowed to rival us. The sea is ours and ours alone, now and forevermore!" 
 ab_eng_abolish_title: "Abolish the Witenagemot" 
 ab_eng_abolish_desc: "The current governing body of Ængland is just inefficient. The Witenagemot has failed to solve the internal issues of Ængland for a long time. Civil wars, deadlocks, and general incompetence has plagued Ænglish for too long. The Cyning has made it his goal to solve this issue. Surely the other Heptarchs would not mind their powers being reduced." 
 ab_eng_abolish.replace_witenagemot_decision_tooltip: "Has replaced the §YWitenagemot§! with the §YWitenred§! via the §YReform the Witenagemot§! decision."
 ab_eng_heptarch_title: "The Heptarch Wars" 
 ab_eng_heptarch_desc: "Things did not go to plan, the reformation of our government was met with resistance from every Heptarch, and the civil war that followed has devasted Ængland. But it was necessary. Now, we can recover, and turn Ængland into a real world power with a government that does not destroy itself." 
 ab_eng_absolutism_title: "Ænglish Absolutism" 
 ab_eng_absolutism_desc: "Years of internal conflict in Ængland has only weakened the Kingdom. The Heptarch wars show that the devolution of powers is a foolish idea. The Cyning should have absolute power over every aspect of the state. Ængland will become stronger than any other nation in the world through the wisdom of the Cyning!" 
 ab_eng_colleges_title: "Marine Colleges" 
 ab_eng_colleges_desc: "Marines are the most important part of our land military, and while strong soldiers are always welcome, we need smart soldiers too. All our marines will go through rigorous mental and physical trials to turn them into the greatest military force in the world." 
 ab_eng_thames_title: "Develop the Thames Valley" 
 ab_eng_thames_desc: "The Thames Valley contains some of the most arable land in all of Britain. The ancient Romans built cities all across the valley that have since fallen from grace. By focusing on developing the towns in the region, we will strengthen our economy to rival that of all of Francia." 
 ab_eng_burh_title: "Fortify the Burhs" 
 ab_eng_burh_desc: "In retrospect, the one downside of rejecting fedualism is the lack of castles and other fortifications to defend our Burhs. Sure the peasants are freer, but history has shown that vikings can raid our shores much easier than the heavily fortified shores of Francia. Local fortifications and trenches should deter any major force from attacking us." 
 ab_eng_regulate_title: "Regulate the Fyrd" 
 ab_eng_regulate_desc: "The Fyrd is a rather outdated system from the middle ages. The levy raised by the kings just does not match up to the standing armies of modern warfare. A national program shall be formed to standardize conscription all across Ængland, reducing the cost of raising the Fyrd." 
 ab_eng_shipyards_title: "Cyninglic Shipyards" 
 ab_eng_shipyards_desc: "We need more ships, that is our constant struggle. If we do not have enough ships, then our most vital towns are in danger from foreign invaders. We need shipyards personally funded by the Cyning to produce ships at unheard of rates to prevent any nation from rivalling our navy." 
 ab_eng_monastic_title: "Monastic Breweries"
 ab_eng_monastic_desc: "Beer is truly the greatest drink to ever be invented, and recently monks have developed a unique way to brew beer. The taste of this beer is amazing, but there is just too little to go around. We need to fund these breweries to ensure that the Cyning and everyone else has access to these luxuries." 
 ab_eng_fair_title: "Scarborough Fair" 
 ab_eng_fair_desc: "The north remains somewhat less developed than the south, constant border clashes with the Scots and viking raids has made it difficult to develop the land properly. Now that the north is finally secured, we can invest in turning the more important cities in the north into proper centers of commerce. Holding an annual fair in the city of Scarborough will attract merchants and artisans from the south and boost our productivity." 
 ab_eng_wool_title: "Expand the Wool Industry" 
 ab_eng_wool_desc: "Wool is truly our most valuable resource, we have plenty of land to raise the sheep, and we have plenty of artisans and workers to weave it into the final product. We need more. By investing in these Burhs and advertising wool as the future to skeptic investors, production will continue to rise nonstop." 
 ab_eng_industrial_title: "The Industrial Revolution" 
 ab_eng_industrial_desc: "Coal is quite the abundant resource here in Ængland, and some clever scholars have found a way to utilize coal to increase production. The steam engine is a modern marvel, allowing machines to do the work of hundreds of men. Soon, all the world will be consuming Ænglish products." 
 ab_eng_rail_title: "Introduce the Railroads" 
 ab_eng_rail_desc: "With all this coal being used to fuel our factories, it is becoming almost impossible to meet the demands of the machines. Luckily, a couple genius inventors have found a way to make a cart power itself without a horse. This new engine is capable of transporting hundreds of times more coal then the horsedrawn carts of yesterday. The future of the entire world belongs to the newly named trains!" 
 ab_eng_workshop_title: "Workshop of the World" 
 ab_eng_workshop_desc: "We have done it; no nation on Earth is even remotely close to our level of industrial output. Across all our cities, millions of laborers work in factories to produce goods shipped all across the world! From London to New York, Hong Kong to Cape Town, all the people of the world will know of the superiority and quantity of Ænglish goods!"
 ab_eng_reach_title: "Extend our Reach" 
 ab_eng_reach_desc: "Our influence does not extend that far beyond the coast of Britain and Calen. If we want any chance of becoming a truly unrivaled power, we need to expand further. A colony established down south in the Maghreb will help project our naval power in Africa and the Meditteranean." 
 ab_eng_amazonia_title: "Explore Amazonia" 
 ab_eng_amazonia_desc: "The Amazon rainforest is some of the most difficult and inhosptitable terrain we have ever encountered, and we live in Ængland. Any colony established there should focus on clearing land to make it arable, then focus on production. We also need to find some crazy enough explorer to go chart out some of the forest for us, if they make it back alive." 
 ab_eng_brazilwood_title: "Gather Brazilwood" 
 ab_eng_brazilwood_desc: "When we first landed in the Amazon, we were shocked by the biodiversity of the region, but we were more shocked by the luxurious wood that is growing everywhere. We can not let any other power have access to these trees, only Ænglish markets will be selling luxury furniture made from this coveted wood." 
 ab_eng_guinea_title: "West African Bases" 
 ab_eng_guinea_desc: "There is a bit more to Africa than we initially anticipated, and obviously the next choice is to further explore and colonize the region. The local natives seem weary of our intentions, but they will soon understand it is better to be Ænglish than Frankish or Andalusian." 
 ab_eng_slave_trade_title: "Expand the Slave Trade" 
 ab_eng_slave_trade_desc: "It is hard to farm cash crops, you know? Back-breaking labor, heatstroke, and very unfavorable conditions just make it seem not worth it to farmers. We have a solution, and while weak-knee liberals and some members of the church might protests, there is plenty of slaves to be had in Africa. Surely no one would look back on this poorly right?" 
 ab_eng_cape_town_title: "Found the Cape Colony" 
 ab_eng_cape_town_desc: "Our continued conquest of the world has run into a slight issue. Africa is quite large and difficult to get around. Our merchants and explorers need rest stops along the way. There is a marvelous spot to establish one of these outposts near the Cape of Good Hope, we just have to beat the other powers there." 
 ab_eng_scramble_title: "Scramble for Africa" 
 ab_eng_scramble_desc: "Africa was once viewed as merely outposts and slavers to us, but now we see that there are many riches to be had inside the dark continent. The other great powers have gotten word of this too, and now we are all scrambling to carve out as much land as we can. The race for Africa has begun, and we shall not lose!" 
 ab_eng_mali_title: "Destroy Mali" 
 ab_eng_mali_desc: "The Kingdom of Mali contains vast amounts of gold, and their traders seem to sell them at unreasonable prices just because they own a lot of it. This ailing empire has run its course, we will end their miserable existence and turn the land into a proper Ænglish colony to reap the gold for ourselves." 
 ab_eng_into_beyond_title: "Into the Beyond" 
 ab_eng_into_beyond_desc: "The world is larger than most think, and some of our more daring explorers have proposed that the riches of Asia are not that far away to the west. Funding these daring ventures should secure us these richers before the other powers. Surely there can not be anything in the way." 
 ab_eng_colonize_carib_title: "Colonize the Caribbean"
 ab_eng_colonize_carib_desc: "Our initial explorations have found a tropical and underpopulated region filled with small islands. Establishing colonies as outpost on some of these islands will allow our explorers to rest while also serving as ports to expand our naval influence in the new world." 
 ab_eng_west_indea_title: "Dominate West Indea" 
 ab_eng_west_indea_desc: "The Caribbean is an excellent region to farm goods such as sugar and cotton. Trade between ports has attracted pirates and privateers all across the world. The Ænglish do not have time for competition, we will kick them out and reap the profits for ourselves." 
 ab_eng_aztec_gold_title: "Seize the Aztec Gold" 
 ab_eng_aztec_gold_desc: "Reports of cities of gold have come from our explorers in Mesoamerica, and the Aztec empire seems to be the source of this gold. Conquering the Aztecs will please other local tribes and also grant us access to more gold for our empire." 
 ab_eng_feorland_title: "Found Feorland" 
 ab_eng_feorland_desc: "There is no place like home, and we discovered a large swathe of land that is very similar to our native Ængland. We should consider establishing a permanent presence there to ensure that whatever wealth is hidden there goes to us. Feorland will become the new crown jewel of the empire!" 
 ab_eng_native_relations_title: "Trade with the Natives" 
 ab_eng_native_relations_desc: "So there was not as much riches in Feorland in the way of gold, but the natives hold secrets on crops that could be sold for much more than basic wheat. Corn, Tobacco, Indigo, all of these can be bought from the natives. Fortunately, the natives are not as militarized as the Aztecs so they will not be as upset that we are buying their land." 
 ab_eng_plains_title: "Settle the Great Plains" 
 ab_eng_plains_desc: "Our explorers tell us of flat rolling plains that are perfect for growing wheat, corn, and potatoes. It is a perfect spot for us to establish farmlands to actually feed our colonists. This influx of food will allow our colonists in Feorland to grow more cash crops instead of food." 
 ab_eng_empire_title: "Transatlantic Empire" 
 ab_eng_empire_desc: "It has been done, the Atlantic has become nothing more than our backyard. Around the clock shipping and naval patrols between our colonies and Ængland has made piracy and privateering a thing of the past. Goods and immigrants flood back and forth, spreading wealth and good Ænglish values wherever they go. The world shall remember the Ænglish empire and its colonies will forever control the Atlantic, God Save the Cyning!" 
 ab_eng_canada_title: "Colonize the North" 
 ab_eng_canada_desc: "The north is bitter and cold, but is does contain lumber necessary to build ships. There are also a few spots filled with arable land for us to establish real cities. The north shall be the lumberyard of the empire, and maybe a nice vacation home for those living in West Indea."

 crn_normandy_title: "Seize Normandy"
 crn_normandy_desc: "Normandy lies on the periphery of the Germanic invaders of Gaul, the Franks. By conquering Normandy we would be increasing our grip on Gaul and it prepares us for future possible conflicts with the Franks."

 crn_insular_church_title: "Insular Kristoneth"

 crn_archbishopric_title: "Archbishopric of Kernow"
 crn_archbishopric_desc: "The clergy have at last established themselves as a formidable force within our realm - teaching the good word to the peasantry and harbouring the sick and ill alike. However, their loyalties and place in the realm remain questionable - do they truly serve us, or stand as an independent faction within our holdings? Let us provide an answer by entrenching ourselves in their dealings."
 crn_fate_title: "Fate of the English"
 crn_fate_desc: "The English are foreigners in Dumonia. These islands are not theirs. They drove our proud forefathers back into the most isolated provinces of the realm. Extinction breathed down our necks until our miraculous resurgence. Now, the time has come to decide their fate. Should the past be made right, or shall we forgive?"
 crn_burhs_title: "Inherit the Burhs"
 crn_burhs_desc: "In an ancient past scarcely remembered, our ancestors erected hill-forts to defend against rivals and, eventually, marauding Romans. Over time, these forts were claimed and repurposed by the Saxons, called 'burhs', to defend against Vikings. With improvements, they would make excellent foundations to even greater forts, with reservoirs of plentiful manpower to draw upon."
 crn_capital_title: "A New Capital"
 crn_capital_desc: "Beyond the Isle of Wight lays the burgeoning Saxon stronghold of 'Witanceastre' - a city they dared call their capital, until they were corrected by our valiant reclamation efforts. With the land in our hands, we have given it the far more fitting title of 'Belgae' - but a name is not enough. The Brittonic tongue must flourish within the city's walls, businesses must thrive and the ports must bustle anew - for our kingdom deserves a better capital than a measly little rural cove."
 crn_revival_title: "Economic Revival"
 crn_revival_desc: "It is no secret that our realm has always been somewhat humble, known for only a handful of resources and industries, albeit rich and well-known. Our tin mines, for instance, have been a staple of our identity for as long as we can remember - some historians claiming that the riches of our mines found themselves as far-flung as the Levant, among the Phoenicians of old. So too have our sailors proven to be proud and fearsome on the high seas. Let us remind the world of our potential by kickstarting our economic output."
 crn_dockyard_title: "Devonport Dockyard"
 crn_dockyard_desc: "With a link to the New World established, our ports lay overwhelmed. Once humble ports are now overcrowded, rife with foreign merchants, slave transports, strange alien oddities and chaos of the highest order. The infrastructure of our realm is ill-equipped to deal with the changing nature of trade. Our merchants propose that we amend the problem by making Dewnens a new grand dockyard of the realm - exploiting its rich naval roots and geographic position."
 crn_discover_title: "Discover the New World"
 crn_discover_desc: "It is said that beyond Land's End, those eternal, jagged cliffs marking the westernmost point of Kernow, that the seas reign and nothing more. Yet for centuries, stories have run abound, let loose by the drunken tongues of Norsemen, Irish monks, Basques and Saracens alike - landfall may be made by the bravest of sailors, should he only have faith and sail."
 crn_caribbean_title: "Colonize the Caribbean"
 crn_caribbean_desc: "While the Eastern Coastline of this new continent is vast and frothing with potential, its southern extent is harsh and swampy, riddled with diseases. While our colonists work hard, yet arduously, to populate its northern extent, our nobles propose an extension of our colonial ventures - a colony in the Caribbean, a region rich with unique fauna and flora, beautiful vistas, maritime exploits and potential farmland. We must claim it!"
 crn_empire_title: "Cornish Empire"
 crn_empire_desc: "Europe has been transformed by its intertwining with the New World - a vast, utterly massive expanse, bigger than any of our forefathers decades ago could even imagine. Day by day, rivals, such as the Franks, Saracens and even the Norsemen, are making colonial headway - establishing dangerous, undeserved footholds in these distant lands. We must look ahead to the future and envision for ourselves a Cornish Empire, stretching from one end of the map to the other - an empire on which the sun never sets."
 crn_eastcoast_title: "Settle the East Coast"
 crn_eastcoast_desc: "The rumours were true - a vast and bountiful land awaited our explorers, rich with bizarre plants, strange peoples and fearsome beasts. Our court shudders with excitement, bewildered and enamoured by tales of the New World, seeing this place of mythological significance tantamount to King Arthur. If we could extend this frenzy to the peasantry, we could surely convince them to migrate there en masse and make this realm a splendid Cornish colony!"#Connacht

 cot_reign_title: "Reign of the High King"
 cot_reign_desc: "In the year 1412, the Crisis of the Ua Naill began. While we were busy attempting to court the newly independent Norse-Gael city states of Dublin, Cork, and Waterford, the Ua Nialls refused our summons to court, and stopped paying their taxes to the High King. Murchadh Ua Conchobair had a tough decision; fighting the Ua Naill would have most likely ended in a pyrrhic victory at best, with their defensible terrain favoring the northern clans. So, Murcadh allowed the clan to go free, and instead work on fostering inter-clan relations. However, this disintegrated trust within the local clans of Ireland, who saw that so long as they had some modicum of power, the Conchobairs wouldn’t be able to stop them from seizing the throne of Ireland. We must establish the authority and power of the High King across Ireland if we are to ever rule this land effectively, bringing back the prosperity we saw before the Anglo Invasions."

Once a series of disconnected clans and kingdoms, we shall create a strong, central authority to govern the entire Ireland. The Conchobair reforms shall be set in stone, and will make Ireland a prosperous nation!"

 cot_secure_kingdom_title: "Secure the Kingdom"
 cot_secure_kingdom_desc: "Connacht, despite being the seat of the High King, is a poor and rural part of the country. To effectively mobilize our troops, we must send word across mountain and marsh; as such, if we are to re-assert our claims across the entirety of Ireland, we must prepare our forces - however long that may take."
 cot_highlands_title: "The Argyll Claim"

 cot_leinster_title: "Control Leinster"

 cot_ulster_title: "Subjugate Ulster"
 cot_ulster_desc: "The Ua Naills have been a thorn in our side for the past 20 years, having broken free from our control and planted rebellious thoughts within the mind of many a Ruirech.

 cot_unite_title: "Unite the Emerald Island"

 cot_galway_desc: "Gaillimh is our home - yet it is not prosperous. It is small, rural, and not nearly as urbanized as the port cities of Cork or Waterford. If we are to project the power and authority of the High King, we must raise the city to new heights."

 cot_invade_england_desc: "For far too long have the English been a thorn in our side. Ever since 1112 and the Great Irish Anglo-Saxon War, they have inspired revolts, taken territory, and slaughtered our people.

 cot_marketrev_title: "The Market Revolution"
 cot_marketrev_desc: "Our coffers are filled and our state is wealthy, but we are witnessing something new occur across our empire. Private enterprises, promising the crown even greater profits, have begun to spring up within our great port cities and industrial towns. They talk of markets and costs and monopolies and companies, and while our High King admittedly has no idea what they are talking about, their numbers do not lie. If we are to embrace this new market revolution, it can make us rich beyond our wildest dreams!"
 cot_borderlands_title: "Imperial Borderlands"
 cot_borderlands_desc: "Our ambitions see us toppling the Frankish Empire and pushing through into the lands of France, and to do so we must take control over these lands just on the borderlands.

 cot_dethrone_title: "Dethrone the Franks"
 cot_dethrone_desc: "The Franks are a mighty empire, but the cracks have shown.

It would not be too hard for us to teach them our ways and create a new Scottish identity in Ireland. Furthermore, the lands are quite fertile, and plantations would make the region more profitable and give us somewhere to send the more resistant Irish."

Unfortunately, some no name philosophers keep proposing the idea of liberty and inalienable rights, whatever that means. Those other philosophers keep spreading discontent throughout our land, but some of their ideas could help us run the government more smoothly, just not the part about free speech."

How are we to get a good deal on spices when they have to go through thousands of miles of merchants price gouging them. Establishing bases along the West African coast will bring us closer to the valuable Indian spices, and give us more land to tax."

 south_africa_colony_SCO_desc: "The southern tip of Africa has become the most important cape for all of Europe. All overseas trade from India passes through it, and our conquest of the cape will ensure that we get a portion of that trade for ourselves.
