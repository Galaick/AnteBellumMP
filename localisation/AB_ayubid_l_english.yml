 hsn_levant_title: "Reconquer Levant"

 hsn_baghdad_title: "Restore Baghdad"
 hsn_baghdad_desc: "The mere thought of what Baghdad was and how it was desecrated by the Mongols brings tears to any Muslim scholar. The very city that signified the existance of the Islamic Golden Age has fallen into disrepair. None of the scientific marvels survived the sacking. Everything that was glorious about the city north of the ancient Persian capital is gone...\n\nBut that does not mean we can't start a new Golden Age.\n\nThe city, though not glorious, boasts a sizable population. This allows for a source of local workers and manpowers. We need to divert state funds towards rebuilding Baghdad into what it once was. We are obligated to bring beauty and glory back to Baghdad. He who repairs Baghdad back to its former glory will go down in history as the one responsible for trying to bring back the Golden Age."
 hsn_wisdom_title: "The House of Wisdom"
 hsn_wisdom_desc: "The House of Wisdom was where all of scientific miracles of Muslim scholars was stored in. It held the greatest intellectuals of the entire Islamic civilization. If we are to bring back the golden age we need to hire the greatest minds of the Islamic world into our court and recreate what was once lost. It will be difficult due to lack of knowledge as to what everything was lost, but it is necessary if we are to bring back the scientific legacy of Islam."
 hsn_conquer_syria_title: "Reclaim Syria"
 hsn_conquer_syria_desc: "The bed of Ayuubid power has fallen out of our hands ever since the Nizzarid coup. As our realm has managed to grow in the last few decades grander there are dreams in our court of returning to our home of power - the place where most of our power lied in.

 hsn_anatolia_title: "Anatolian Incursion"
 hsn_anatolia_desc: "Anatolia must be the very definition of desolation. War, death, chaos and destruction are all that exist in the region as it keeps switchnig hands between differing people.

We need a strong bufferzone against the Anatolian chaos if we don't want any of the Anatolian wars to spill over to our lands."
 hsn_purge_title: "Purge the Crusader States"
 hsn_purge_desc: "The Crusaders are a worthy disease. Though they came as vile uncivilized beasts the subsequent wars where they held their ground had them prove themselves capable of honor. Honor, however, is not enough to justify one of Islam's holy cities being in control of infidels. We must give the Crusaders one last war of honor: The war to reclaim Al-Quds back to Islam."
 hsn_cyprus_title: "Secure Cyprus"
 hsn_cyprus_desc: "Cyprus is last of crusader states and also one of the few crusader states located outside of traditional Islamic civilization. The conquest of Cyprus would allow us to expand spread of Islam to a new region and secure properly South-East Mediterranean trade."

 hsn_oman_title: "Claim Omani Wealth"

 hsn_arabia_title: "The Birthplace of Islam"
 hsn_arabia_desc: "Islam is the true faith, and the true caliphates of Islam have often ruled over the entire peninsula. Though we are but a Sultanate and most of Arabia is inhospitable desert our status as a resurgent powerhouse in the region puts an indirect pressure on us to try reunite the Arab tribes once more. Let history be repeated and have the birthplace of Islam be united under one banner - under Ayuubid banner."
 hsn_aden_title: "Secure the Gulf of Aden"
 hsn_aden_desc: "The Spice trade flows through Aden, and it is one of the most coveted after trades in the world as both Muslims and Christians desire for it for all the wealths it brings.

Let us milk the rich infidels dry with our spice prices. They will have no choice but to pay."
