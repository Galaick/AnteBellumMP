By 1444 Nestorianism is mainly prevalent in and near the Eurasian Steppes, having long since spread beyond the Levant."
 icon_nestorius: "Icon of St. Nestorius"
 icon_nestorius_desc: "St. Nestorius was a bishop of Constantinople in the 5th century. He is best known for his teachings on the nature of Jesus Christ, which were considered heretical by many other Christians at the time.\n\nNestorius taught that Jesus Christ was not one person, but rather two persons: one divine and one human. He believed that the divine and human natures of Christ were separate and distinct, and that they were united in Christ only by faith. This belief, known as Nestorianism, was opposed by many other Christian leaders, who believed that Jesus was fully divine and fully human in one person.\n\nNestorius was condemned as a heretic at the Council of Ephesus in 431, and was later exiled to a monastery in Egypt. Despite his condemnation, some Christians continued to follow his teachings, and Nestorianism spread throughout the Middle East and Asia. Today, there are several churches that follow Nestorian teachings, including the Assyrian Church of the East."

He also established a system of hereditary succession for the patriarchate, which caused some controversy and led to a split in the church. Despite these challenges, Mar Shimun is remembered as a significant figure in the history of the Church of the East and its growth and development."

His epistle, which is included in the Bible as Jude, is a short letter that focuses on the importance of persevering in faith and fighting against false teachings. The letter is addressed to 'those who are called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ,' and encourages its readers to defend the faith and remain faithful to God.\n\nHe is the patron saint of desperate cases and lost causes, and is often invoked for help in difficult or hopeless situations. In art, St. Jude is often depicted holding a boat or a club, symbols of his occupation as a fisherman before becoming an apostle."

After Jesus' death and resurrection, Thomas is said to have preached the gospel in India, where he eventually died as a martyr."

He is also known for his powerful sermons, which were known to have converted many people to Catholicism. He is considered one of the most popular saints in the Catholic Church, and is often invoked for help in finding lost items."

After a failed raid left him permanently crippled in AD 1363, he renounced his past and converted to Nestorian Christianity.\n\nSaint Timur is most known for his conversion of the Chagatai Khanate, which was infamous for its persecutions of Nestorians and other Christians.

 gaelic_ab_flav.1.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Archbishop"
 gaelic_ab_flav.1.d: "The Gaelic Church was founded on both secular and religious differences from the Catholic Church. The primary secular concern was the influence of the mainland within Gaelic politics, to the point that they could decide rulers and enforce rulings upon the Gaelic states from afar, while the religious concern laid in a revival of Celtic and Insular traditions across both Ireland and the Highlands. As such, the Gaelic Church implemented an archbishopric system among the bishops of their state, who’s authority came from God as well as the High Kings, and could better enforce rulings and make decisions for their realm. This tradition is often muddled with corruption and internal struggles, and even though the election of an archbishop is meant to be decided by a series of electors, it is often funded by lords and ladies wishing for political problems to be solved through the words of the pious. Thus, no one knows for sure who will become the archbishop when elected, but it can be assumed that there is some manipulation at play."

 ab_mani.10.d: "Our current government was born out of a zeal for the Divine, and while this has been advantages when it comes to governance of a great nation such as ours, the religious zealotry with which our state is run has gotten us into a bit of a bind as of recent. Not long ago, we reinstated the position of “Yamag”, and based his court in Samarkand. However, it seems the power of this new position has got to the old fool’s head, and he has openly challenged our Shah in front of the whole Council of Elect to increase his influence in governing matters citing religious instability as a reason to delegate further authority to the Yamagate. He warns, not-so-subtly, if we do not concede to these demands, the Divine may withdraw his support from our new regime."

Now, he comes to us and asks how he may further be of use, in the name of the divine of course."

Unfortunately, this bothersome habit has cropped up at the worst of times.
