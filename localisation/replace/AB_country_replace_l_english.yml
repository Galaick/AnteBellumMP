 EVTDESC2001: "Following centuries of internal division and external setbacks amongst the realms of Christendom, dissent towards the Roman Catholic Church has reached a fever pitch, with many viewing it as a feeble and crumbling institution. Having failed time and again to protect Christians from Saracens and bloodthirsty pagans alike, preferring instead to embellish the Vatican coffers and peddle indulgences like produce at a market, the pietas and legitimacy of the Church is increasingly questioned openly. Where once dissidents could only speak in hushed whispers, they now take to the streets and town squares to protest clerical corruption, even in the face of persecution by ecclesiastical authorities. In light of this paradigm shift, a disillusioned theologian in $CAPITAL$, who has expressed deep concern regarding the Church's apathy towards its own flock for some time, is now openly declaring his discontent with Rome, spearheading the calls for a reformation of the faith."
