 #Bohemia
 wenceslas: "Crown of St. Wenceslas"
 wenceslas_desc: "The estates of Bohemia hold immense power and are the ones who elect the future Bohemian king. Even though the dynasties of Premyslids and Luxembourgs made the election seem hereditary, it was mostly done by granting various privileges to the estates or buying enough votes. We must be cautious and do not enrage the estates if we wish to keep our dynasty on the throne."
 bohmining: "Reform Bergordnung"
 bohmining_desc: "The mining laws and regulations should be reviewed and if needed, reformed and modernized. If we manage to create a good environment for the miners, all of Bohemia will prosper!"
 bohelection: "Support of the Nobles"
 bohelection_desc: "The election of a king in Bohemia is largely controlled by the estates of our lands. If we wish to retain the throne for our dynasty, we must ensure that the estates are always backing our candidate."
 bohsnem: "Zemsky Snem"
 bohsnem_desc: "The growth of our realm requires an establishment of a new constitutional body. The new Bohemian Diet will ensure that the lords and peasants of the lands of the Bohemian crown have an extensive share in the political sphere."
 #Francia
 frankish_crown: "Frankish Monarchy"
 frankish_crown_desc: "Even though Feudalism had not caused the Western Frankish Kingdom to fragment as much as the Eastern Empire had, the bonds of vassalage and granting of fiefs still plays an important role in Frankish society. A ruler has to have the support of the feudal lords and the most powerful of them are there to keep his power in check."
 frapalatium: "Palatium"
 frapalatium_desc: "Historically, the Frankish Emperors relied on Palatium, a shifting assemblage of family members, trusted lay and ecclesiastical companions, and assorted hangers-on, which constituted an itinerant court following the king as he carried out his military campaigns and sought to take advantage of the income from widely scattered royal estates. Members of this circle, some with titles suggesting primitive administrative departments, performed on royal orders various functions related to managing royal resources, conducting military campaigns and diplomatic missions, producing written documents required to administer the realm, undertaking missions across the kingdom to enforce royal policies, rendering justice, conducting religious services, and counseling the king."
 fracavalry: "Frankish Knights"
 fracavalry_desc: "The strong cavalry traditions of our armies date back to the times of Charles Martel. Even the mighty Emperor Charlemagne used large numbers of cavalry during his campaigns of conquest. We must further strengthen the position of cavalry in our armed forces and equip them with the newest weaponry so that they may wreak havoc on the battlefield."
 frcoriflamme: "Institute the Porte-Oriflamme"
 frcoriflamme_desc: "The practice of using standards in warfare dates all the way back to the time of the Romans, with regiments rallying behind their standard and generals using this to organize armies more efficiently. Recently, however, each Duke and Noble in the Kingdom has their own system of standards, making it difficult for us to organize a cohesive army. Instead, let us create a uniform standard system for our regiments, allowing for cohesion and unity between ranks."
 frcfeudalism: "Strengthen Frankish Feudalism"
 frcfeudalism_desc: "The Frankish realm has always relied on the loyalty of Dukes and Nobles to keep the state together. We should further expand this and grant more autonomy to our vassals. This allows us to not have to directly handle the burden of managing their land and ensures that the nobles stay loyal. Of course this weakens the central authority of the King, but earning the loyalty of our vassals is worth it."
 mechanic_unlocks_strong_duchies_privilege_yes: "Unlocks the §YStrong Duchies§! privilege."
 frcassembly: "Imperial Assembly"
 frcassembly_desc: "The Imperial Assemblies and Diets have constantly changed purpose and organization over the past few centuries. Originally serving as an advisory and law-making body for Charlemagne, the Assembly slowly but surely weakened the power of the Emperor over time in favor of the Princes. It is now time for us to reform this system into something that fits our interest more. This new Imperial Assembly will serve as a confirmation of Frankish supremacy across the Empire, and allow us to return powers delegated to the Princes."
 mechanic_gain_dip_on_emperor_reelection_yes: "Grants §G100§! £dip£ upon each successive Imperial re-election."
 frcstate: "State Catholicism"
 frcstate_desc: "The Catholic Church and the Franks have always had a deep history together. Starting with the Baptism of Clovis and the conversion of the Franks, to the coronation of Charlemagne, to the Crusades in the Levant and Iberia, The King and the Church have always had a special relationship. It is time we further solidify this relationship into law, making Catholicism our official state religion and persecuting heretics and heathens alike. Grand Dieu Sauve le Roi!"
 frcrepresentatives: "Representatives of the Empire"
 frcrepresentatives_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire is a diverse and complicated mess of Princes, clergymen, and a growing burgher class. If we are to effectively rule over such a mess, it must be organized to prevent conflicts and bloodshed between these estates. We will create a department entirely dedicated to handling the disputes between Princes to keep the Empire together."
 frcrenaissance: "Second Carolingian Renaissance"
 frcrenaissance_desc: "Before the reign of Charlemagne, Europe was going through a dark age in its history. Literacy, law, order, arts, and culture had all disappeared with the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It was not until the rule of Charlemagne and his descendants that these ideas would return and flourish in the Frankish Empire. The Renaissance in Italy is not unlike the Caroligian one that took place centuries earlier, and we should strive to fund the arts and sciences to create a new Carolingian Renaissance centered around Francia."

 norjvikings: "Restore the Jomsviking Order"
 noralthing: "Adopt the Althing"
 norcolonize_desc: "The Norwegian people have made a name for ourselves as explorers, navigators, and seafarers. The quest for new lands is our national imperative. When we set sail, it is on the backs of the great Viking explorers that came before us."
 norpatronage_desc: "Respect for the eldest and wisest in our society is paramount to the Norwegian people. Let us ensure that we have the guidance of our progenitors in mind when it comes to the governance of our kingdom."
 norsanction_desc: "The Christian kingdom of Sweden threatens our very way of life with its proximity. The Norwegian people must not be made to forget the Aesir!"
 northralls_desc: "Thralls, the lowest class in our society, have long been exploited and abused by the nobility. Despite their diminutive status, we must establish legal protections for them to assure their loyalty."
 norvarangian_desc: "The Varangians, elite Viking mercenaries tasked with protecting the Emperor of the Romans, often return to Norway after their tenure in his stead. These invaluable veterans can be re-employed in service of the king of their own nation."
 norjvikings_desc: "The Saga of the Jomsvikings tells the story of a band of nigh-invincible norse mercenaries who lent their services to great kings both foreign and domestic. True students of history understand this Saga to be more than a story, but instead a record of historical fact! The restoration of the Jomsviking order will provide a prestigious upper echelon for our soldiers to strive towards, and those members of it will be the finest warriors in the land."
 mechanic_unlocks_jomsvikings_yes: "Unlocks the §YJomsvikings§! mercenary company"
 noralthing_desc: "The Althing was a kind of parliament established by Icelandic residents many years ago. This representative body was an outlet for the common people to voice their concerns and ideas regarding the nation's governance. Perhaps by adopting a similar governmental body, we could smooth our transition from a highly stratified society into a much more egalitarian structure."

 #Hisn Kayfa reforms
 hsnscholars: "Invite Western Scholars"
 hsnscholars_desc: "The western scholars of Europe follow a religion that disgraces the word of Allah which is very unfortunate, and to most it would be enough of a reason to keep them as far from their lands as humanly possible, thankfully we are much more wise than that. They may spew heresy but among those words are those of wisdom, ever since the Mongols sacked the Middle East, the Islamic Golden age has ended, and Christian Europe has been slowly but surely surpassing us in terms of engineering, medicine and math, in times like these we should seek the wisdom of these people."
 hsnatabegs: "Assign Atabegs"
 hsnatabegs_desc: "When the Seljuks rolled through the region they needed a way to govern those they conquered, Atabegs were their answer, nobles of Turkic blood that would govern an entire region, by Seljuk law they would even start their own dynasties in those regions which connected their family's destiny to regions of governance, this reduced any ambition which might have hurt the ruler otherwise. By employing a similar system in our conquered territories our administrative pressure would decrease significantly."
 hsnwaqf: "Waqf Donations"
 hsnwaqf_desc: "Waqf is a donation of money or property for religious reasons, as the Abbasids we are the true representatives of the Sword of Islam and thus have the right to encourage and exploit these donations in our favor, let's do just that!"
 hsntolerate: "Tolerate Religious Minorities"
 hsntolerate_desc: "Anatolia is not Arabia, unlike Arabia this place is not almost solely dominated by the servants of Allah, instead the region is packed to the brim with Orthodox Christians, Coptic Christians, Zoroastrians and many even smaller regional beliefs, instead of slamming our head against a wall by trying to convert each and every religious minority, destabilizing our country in the process, we should instead encourage those communities to preach whatever they want without state oppression."
 hsnmadrasa: "Madrasa and Madhab Schools"
 hsnmadrasa_desc: "Both Madrasa and Madhab schools have very similar purposes, to not only teach the children of Allah how to be better believers by making them learn the Quaran and Islamic law, but also educating them in science and in the Arabic language, we should focus our finances and efforts into the construction and expansion of such schools across our nation so that our citizens are the smartest they could be." 
 #Hansa
 hansahansetag: "Hansetag"
 hansahansetag_desc: "The Hansetag is a parlament esque body of representatives, each representing one of the many cities of the Hanseatic League, the Hansetag is called each time an issue encompasses multiple League cities, during the meeting the issue is addressed and hopefully resolved. \n \n The Hansetag has served us wonderfully so far, promoting unity within the league while also guaranteeing autonomy and rights to every city, if we want our league to prosper we should encourage and expand the Hansetag."
 hansacentralize: "Centralize the League"
 hansacentralize_desc: "As new cities become integrated into the League a massive problem arises, the massive decentralization makes it impossible to effectively govern them all, we simply cannot cater to every need and whim of every single city withouth creating problems for other cities or without exhausting our bureaucracy, a new controversial approach is needed. \n \n If we centralize our grip over the many autonomous cities we can resolve the many issues they face with much more independence and without the fear of upsetting some stuck up merchant family in another city 300km away. \n \n This will be a very controversial move that will no doubt inspire many protests from the autonomous cities, some even argue that centralizing our rule might kill the soul and purpose of the League, but with this reform we can focus on much more important matters then petty squables between cities while also guaranteeing their true rights and autonomy."
 hansaleifland: "Expand the Leifland Company"
 hansaleifland_desc: "The New World has so much untapped economic potential it is almost unbelievable that so little of it is utilized, sugar, coffee, some of the most fertile land in the world, tobbacco, corn, so many new fruits and mountains upon mountains of gold, it seems as If the continent not so long ago discovered is a land of milk and honey, but most importantly profit. \n \n The vast pools of resources sitting on this empty land almost beg to be used. \n \n So far the Leifland Company has asisted us in the colonization of these rich lands, the brains of the company allowed us to tap into these riches, making the ports of North Germany an entry for all these goods to the rest of central europe, but if we want to truly exploit all that God has laid down for us just one ocean away, we will need to massively expand the company's operation."
 hansacolonial: "Colonial Governors"
 hansacolonial_desc: "Our power lies in the New World where rich colonies produce massive amounts of money, the colonies indeed became so massive and rich that their issues outgrew the issues of League Cities in their importance, maybe the League at first was to cater to German city states in the north, but as of right now the League mainly exists to transport new world goods to the German cities, from which they spread across the rest of europe, it is time to acknowledge reality and stop clinging upon our old ideals, the League should be redesigned in a way that gives colonial governors true control over it, so that the whims of little cities in Germany no longer holds the League back."
 #Armenia
 armazatavrear: "Azatavrear Cavalry"
 armazatavrear_desc: "Our cavalry has been the envy of our neighbours for thousands of years. Not only has Armenia historically boasted a rich supply of horses, but also a martial aptitude and tradition for them. Even in peacetime, our Ayrudzi- collected from a myriad of classes throughout our long history, from the most humble of peasants to the most courageous of noble sons- found great experience and use in patrolling our precarious borders and guarding our king. Let us empower and encourage this persevering tradition."
 armnakharar: "Confirm the Nakharar Order"
 armnakharar_desc: "Nakharars, as they are known, are our nobles. Before even Christ's word graced our lands, Armenia consisted of tightly-knit, insular noble houses, hesitant to branch outwards into greater Caucasia and the Levant, preferring internal marriages and practicing steadfast endogamy. If we were to retain this practice and enrich our Nakharars with military expertise and experience, our nobility could become an ardently loyal military behemoth for centuries to come."
 armcrusader: "Crusader Nobility"
 armcrusader_desc: "Owing to our precarious position, it seems only appropriate that our nobility primarily consist of those with both will and aptitude for carrying out the Lord's will. While our wise and weathered clergy is demonstrative of the might of the divine pen, the zealous sword must not be neglected- and enriching our nobility with both prospective and veteran crusaders alike is an excellent start to this endeavour." 
 armfleet: "Expand the Merchant Fleet"
 armfleet_desc: "Provided we retain our miraculous gateway to the Mediterranean and pursue further openings to the seas, our merchants could more than double their current efficiency and establish a firm Armenian presence in the world of trade. Investing preferential treatment towards the construction and protection of our merchant fleet could expand their capacity significantly and thus enrich our coffers significantly."
 armchurch: "Reinforce the Apostolic Church"
 armchurch_desc: "Throughout our long and tired history, the Apostolic Church has found itself not only beaten down by marauding heathens, but also our own fellow brothers in faith, deeming our methodology and beliefs heretical. No more should we doubt ourselves, see us as half-hearted faithful- should we empower our church, giving it paramount preference within our holdings, we would draw in conversions at a far greater rate."
 armgreaterarmenia: "Resettle Greater Armenia"
 armgreaterarmenia_desc: "Over the years, Armenians across Caucasia and Anatolia alike have faced discrimination, assimilation and removal outright from our ancestral homelands and hard-earned frontiers. If we were to focus our efforts on resettlement and reclamation, the number of bold hearts among our tried and true Armenian population would grow, fostering a spirit and culture of colonisation and resettlement."
 #Pope
 mission_expand_orders: "Mission to Expand the Holy Orders"
 mission_expand_orders_desc: "Since their establishment, the military orders have played a significant role in the Catholic world. Their members were one of the first who answered the call to defend the Holy City against the Muslim horders, and for that, we shall reward their bravery by inviting them to permanently settle in our lands."
 #Byzantium
 imperial_autocracy: "Imperial Autocracy"
 imperial_autocracy_desc: "Since the times of ancient Rome, the Emperor of the Romans stood as the undisputed Autocrat and absolute ruler of his country. This tradition persisted to this day and the Byzantine Empire is almost solely ruled by the single person who listens to no one but a few of his most trusted advisors."
 varangian_guard: "Varangian Guard"
 varangian_guard_desc: "Let us re-establish the mighty Varangian Guard - a personal bodyguard unit of the Emperor himself. This elite force, lacking any political loyalties except the loyalty to the Basileus can be always counted upon, unlike our treacherous nobility."
 mechanic_unlocks_varangian_guard_yes: "Enables the §YVarangian Guard§! mercenary company which costs §G0.0%§! Army Professionalism to recruit."
 roman_bureaucracy: "Roman Bureaucracy"
 roman_bureaucracy_desc: "Rome, in its more than two thousands years of history, developed an intricate bureaucracy to rule its expanded territories. As it went from a small city state on the Tiber river to having to govern an empire spanning Europe, West Asia and North Africa, it had adapt and innovate in order to maintain control of its empire."

 byztagmata: "Tagmata Armies"
 byzthemata: "Themata Armies"
 byzconstitution: "Imperial Constitution"
 byzabsolutism: "Roman Absolutism"
 byzabsolutism_desc: "The Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans is the final authority on all matters in our land. The rise of the so called 'national monarchs' throughout Europe has seemed little more than a too-late consolidation of feudal chaos to the eternal and absolute Romans."
 byztheme_desc: "The Theme system is the organizational structure of the Roman Empire, in which the realm is divided into provinces called "Themes", each led by a Strategos, a military and political official who is tasked with adjudicating disputes, managing the theme's economy, and most importantly, conscripting troops into the Imperial Army."
 byzhellenization_desc: "The lands of Egypt and the Levant have fallen to the cultural and religious influence of arab-muslim powers since their conquest centuries ago. With these lands coming back into the fold, it follows that we should re-settle the cities of this region with Greeks."
 byztagmata_desc: "The Tagmata armies are the personal troops of the Emperor. These elite troops are conscripted from around the empire and often fight alongside foreign auxillaries like the Varangians, Catalans, or Heruli."
 byzthemata_desc: "The Themata armies are commanded by the Strategoi and conscripted from the Themes. These troops almost entirely consist of native Greeks from the countryside, and are larger and cheaper than the Tagmata."
 byzconstitution_desc: "The Empire, despite its absolute rule by the Basileius, runs on paper. The laws of the Romans have been codified over the centuries in scattered legal books, but now it is time to compile the most important of these laws into a constitution."
 byzsenate: "Delegate to the Synkletos"
 byzsenate_desc: "Historically, the Synkletos, the senate of our proud empire, had a myriad of functions and powers. It passed resolutions which the Emperor could adopt and issue as he pleased, suggested Imperial legislation and has even acted as a consultative body and judicial court. In recent centuries, this proud arm of our mighty government has been eroded and reduced to dust, but if we were to reintroduce it with our restored strength, embraced modernity and resurgent capacities, it could hail a new era of Imperial efficiency and civil fairness." 
 #Sicily
 sicsultanate: "Sultanate of Sicily"
 sicsultanate_desc: "The Sulatanate of Sicily maintains a rather absolute system of rule under Sharia law with the emir in charge of many state duties, but it is notable for its tolerance among Muslim realms with its many Christians and Jews populating Eastern Sicily and South Italy."
 sicitaliyya: "Sublime State of Italiyya"
 sicitaliyya_desc: "Through a long and hard fought campaign spanning several centuries, the original invaders of Sicily have managed to proclaim an empire in Italiyya. As a new courtly culture coalesces and the Islamization of one of the hearts of Christendom is felt more every day, the Italiyyan Sultanate indisuputably reigns supreme over her surroundings."
 sicqadi: "Empower the Qadi"
 sicqadi_desc: "The Sultan carries the very important duty of appointing Qadi, or judges, for the various provinces of the state. These Islamic judges often solved local disputes and religious matters, allowing residents to sort things out peacefully with a mediator, and letting the Sultan not need to worry as much about direct administration."
 siccurrency: "Standardize the Currency"
 siccurrency_desc: "In the past, the Sultanate of Sicily used a single currency; the dinar which was introduced by the Arabic conquerors of the island. However, over time, many more new currencies such as Dirhems or Kharrubas, leading to unnecessary confusion and troubles with exchange rates. In order to get rid of this problem once for all, we shall introduce a single currency that shall be used throughout the entire Sultanate."
 sicreform: "The Land Reform"
 sicreform_desc: "Following the Islamic conquest of Sicily, land reforms were initiated to transform the island into a more Arabic system of governance. This resulted in many new and exotic crops being introduced to Sicily during the agricultural revolution, and smallholding farms being encouraged to increase productivity."
 sicrecruits: "Berber Recruits"
 sicrecruits_desc: "Though the Sultanate now rules over a largely Roman populace, the battle hardened armies of the Sultan are often recruited from across the Mediterranean in North Africa. While these armies tend to fight for gold and glory rather than the Sultanate, they are always loyal to the Sultan with little interest for local politics, caring more for fighting Christians in North Italy."
 sicfleet: "Expand the Fleet"
 sicfleet_desc: "Our position in the middle of the Mediterranean gives us the perfect chance to become a true ruler of the waves, controlling the naval routes from Balansiyah to Iskandariyya. The state shall fund the great expansion of our naval forces."
 sicitalo: "Italo-Arabic Governance"
 sicitalo_desc: "As our Arab and Islamic origins become more intertwined with local Italian customs, a distinct culture has coalesced in the ruling class of many of our cities. Through combining Italian and Arabic language, and adopting many of the traditional practices of each, this culture is sure to be of use in efficient communication among the ruling classes of the Sultanate. This is now also reflected in the upper class and administration of our country where many important positions are occupied by persons of Latin or Christian origins."
 sicgiama: "Giama'a Assembly"
 sicgiama_desc: "Though the Sultan performs many of the important state duties, there has always been an administrative council supporting his decisions, made up of the most notable figures in court. With the Giama'a supporting the state, policies can often pass without major opposition."
 sicabsolutism: "Islamic Absolutism"
 sicabsolutism_desc: "The Sultan is in charge of many key aspects of state, such as the army, administration, and justice. By institutionalizing these powers as part of the office of Sultan we can further legitimize the strong centralized rule of the state."
 sicambition: "Italiyyan Ambition"
 sicambition_desc: "In our ruthless campaign to conquer the heart of the Mediterranean for Islam, our state has faced many a foe and adapted many reforms. However, throughout this relentless push we have remained stable and prosperous, and the countless victories have showered us in glory, allowing our rulers to call truly themselves the Sultans of Italiyya."
 #Iberia
 iberian_crown: "Iberian Crown"
 iberian_crown_desc: "The foundation of the Iberian kingdom was built on the backs of crusaders and the faithful. Our state, in turn, shall be designed around our Christian identity, and be a haven for all those who wish to worship Christ."
 ibeintegrate: "Integrate the Moriscos"
 ibeintegrate_desc: "Although the north of Iberia is firmly Christian, the south is a haven for the remaining Muslim population leftover from Andalusia. We shall integrate the Morisco culture into our own, and grant protection to these diverse peoples in our realm."
 ibebanish: "Banish the Moriscos"
 ibebanish_desc: "While the heathen has been removed from power, there still lies an enemy within our country. We shall push them out, either to the Maghreb or to the New World, so that we might create a new realm for those who are true to Christ!"
 ibecouncils: "Reform the Municipal Councils"
 ibecouncils_desc: "The various cities and towns across the peninsula have been semi-autonomous for the last several centuries, implementing laws and collecting taxes as they pleased. However, if we want our realm to be administered far more effectively, we should work to centralize and reform the way these municipal councils are run."
 ibeviceroyalties: "Establish the Viceroyalties"
 ibeviceroyalties_desc: "The conquest of the new world has brought us wealth beyond our wildest dreams. However, we must make sure that we administer these new territories in a just and fair manor. With the establishment of these Viceroyalties, the laws of the Crown apply in Iberia as well as they do in the Americas."
 ibeorders: "Reorganize the Orders"
 ibeorders_desc: "The Holy Orders aided us in our rise to power against the Andalusians. If we were to structure them so that they answered only to the King himself, these Orders could be quite effective in future conquests…"
 ibeadmiralty: "Found the Admiralty"
 ibeadmiralty_desc: "As our kingdom grows and expands across the waves, we need intelligent and willing leadership to guard our sails as we seek to dominate both land and sea!"
 ibesantiago: "Knights of Santiago"
 ibesantiago_desc: "Since the early years of the Reconquista, a multitude of Holy Orders sanctioned by the Papacy have assisted the faithful in repelling the heathens of the south with varying success. As the Reconquista has finally ended, many Knights in their service have put forward the idea that they continue their service to God under our protection. Their skills, resources and expertise in warfare will certainly be useful in our future conquests. Most notably, the Knights of Santiago may be a valuable asset for our armies."
 mechanic_unlocks_knights_of_santiago_yes: "Unlocks the §YKnights of Santiago§! mercenary company."
 ibepatronato: "Patronato Real"
 ibepatronato_desc: "Our realm's Papal ties are forged from a Centuries-old bond between the Christian people of Iberia, who were cruelly beset on all sides by the heathens of Andalusia. With the Umayyad Caliphate long out of memory, we now turn to further merging Church and State. By enacting a system of Patronage with Rome's assent, the Crown will be granted direct authority over the clergy and their appointments."
 ibepaternal: "Paternal and Absolute"
 ibepaternal_desc: "The people are much akin to a flock of sheep; easily frightened and misled. It is for this reason that the commoners cannot be trusted to lead themselves, and so the responsibility of state governance falls upon the Crown and its most loyal Council. Like a paternal figure, the Crown shall guide Iberia's subjects along a prosperous and devoutly Catholic path, protecting them from any harm that may lie in waiting. Then, too, shall the Crown remain as the Supreme authority in the nation; Absolute in their rule and regality as paramount sovereigns, Iberia's monarchs answer only to God above."
 ibecounciliberia: "Council of Iberia"
 ibecounciliberia_desc: "The State Councils of the various entities held in union by the Iberian Crown have administered their portions of the Empire separately from one another. Rather ashamedly, this has been done with comparatively little cooperation and cohesion when held up to the likes of England's Witenred or Francia's Estates General. Following in the footsteps of other centralised governing bodies, the realm shall henceforth be administered by a single Council of Iberia. This assembly will in turn answer only to His Majesty and, failing him, God."
 ibecolonialinqui: "Colonial Inquisition"
 ibecolonialinqui_desc: "Despite our domestic efforts in restoring Catholic order through assimilation and legal reform, there are still those abroad who retain their heretical ways. These colonial heathens openly kneel before false idols and plot to bring about the empire's downfall. The time has come to uproot the entrenched pagans of our overseas territories, for inaction will make way for further sedition. What better way to do enforce unity than by sending abroad what nobody expects?"

Those lands are mostly inhabited by people of various ethnics and faiths, such as the Arabs or the Jews. We can't be foolish and believe that giving those people religious freedom will eventually buy us their loyalty. The religious mission is bound to carry on and all those who live under our banners shall follow the true faith!"
 #Bulgaria
 bultsardom: "Bulgarian Tsardom"
 bultsardom_desc: "Bulgaria is well accustomed to the prestigious title of Tsardom - ever since Simeon the Great first proclaimed himself ''Emperor of Bulgarians and Greeks", bulgarianizing the roman title of Caesar into Tsesar, or later Tsar, Bulgaria has hailed every single one of the rulers after him as Tsars no matter the state or size of our country at the time. When the brothers Asen revolted against the Romans to our south in 1185, it was only logical that they continue the legacy of the First Empire - this title grants prestige, good cause for continued attacks on the Romans, and a place on the world stage far above any of our South Slavic neighbours."
 bulliterary: "New Literary School"
 bulliterary_desc: "The cultural Golden Age that lasted throughout Simeon the Great's reign was made possible because of his hospitality towards the many scholars and men of sciences that passed through the vast territories of Bulgaria at the time, some of which stayed and continued to pour their wisdom into the nation. Of course, we needed to preserve this knowledge so that it may be saved from the destructive sands of time. What the Tsar did was as such- he poured a considerable sum of money into building Literary Schools that would be used to house scholarly works and also be a place where commoners could go and get an introduction/education of the various sciences of the time. We would be wise to start the construction of the same types of schools so that our ever-growing population can hopefully learn from them and eventually push Bulgaria into another Golden Age. "
 bulkavkhan: "Reintroduce the Kavkhan"
 bulkavkhan_desc: "In the First Bulgarian Empire,  Kavkhan was a title that was given to the right hand of the Khan (Before Boris I converted Bulgaria to Christianity) and the Tsars - they would have a number of responsibilities and concentrated huge power and authority. The title was hereditary, a prominent boyar family would be picked generation after generation, and it was for life. The Kavkhan was also the commander-in-chief of the Bulgarian Army and one of the primary diplomats of the country. Kavkhans were often regents or even co-rulers. Interestingly enough the Asen dynasty have not yet brought the title back into the Empire, regardless of the strength and stability that a loyal boyar in such a position would give."
 bulreform: "Reform the Government"
 bulreform_desc: "Some reforms are necessary so that we can reduce the administrative strain on our nation from conquered territories. We should follow the example of the Western centralised states such as the Franks and also try to streamline the process of integration, paperwork, conversion, tax collection, and army conscription. If we can achieve the tasks we have put out for ourselves, we will see great benefits as a result of our work."

 bulsiege_desc: "Bulgaria learned first hand through the brutal siege of Tsarigrad the importance of swift and decisive sieges. Additionally the benefits of artillery in battle are undeniable. Perhaps a focus on good artillery pieces will not only make for faster conquests, but cheaper conquests overall."
 bulboyar: "Boyar Representation"
 bulboyar_desc: "Boyar representation was an achievement of the First Bulgarian Empire through the use of a Boyar Council, which stood as an executive body that also offered plans of action to the Tsar and through the influence of the powerful Boyar class, give the means and resources to put such plans into action. Reintroducing such a body will first off, help the Bulgarian nobility and the Tsar find fast solutions to problems and unite to remove them, and second off, it will satisfy the nobles on their demand for representation in the administration of the realm. The Counsel may be a bit awkward at first regarding its dealings, but as soon as the task, the meaning, and purpose of the Council are understood by all participants, it will be a good guiding hand that will lead and shield Bulgaria from the problems it may run into. "
 bulcumans: "Cuman Mercenaries"
 bulcumans_desc: "Where would we be without our valiant brothers-in-arms, the Cumans? They have been helping us ever since Bulgaria came back on the stage of Europe. They trick, pounce and kill our prideful enemies, who are always dumb enough the blindly charge at a smaller force regardless of how many times they get taught a lesson. Frankly, the Cumans will always be useful to us, so we best make sure that we keep our good relations with them."

 mvanitra: "Empower the Prince of Nitra"
 mvanitra_desc: "Principality of Nitra is one of the core regions of Moravia. The Slovak lands are administered separately by a member of our dynasty, usually a heir to the Moravian throne. If we gave Nitra even more freedom, we could ensure that the future king of Moravia gains enough experience while governing the duchy so that once he ascends the throne, he will already know how to rule and govern the realm."
 mvafort: "Reinforce the Fort System"
 mvafort_desc: "Since the times of Mojmír and Rastislav, our country was well known for having very advanced fort systems. Our defense lines were very important and were also the key in our victories against the Magyar hordes. We must further reinforce and renovate the fort system, ensuring the safety of our country and its inhabitants."
 mvapohotovost: "Pohotovost"
 mvapohotovost_desc: "Pohotovost is a military force which consists mainly of lower class citizens who are usually not trained or professional warriors. However, thanks to their numbers and knowledge of the prevalent types of weapons, they represent a serious military force."
 mvasphere: "Restore the Sphere of Influence"
 mvasphere_desc: "Moravia was once the hegemon of the Slavic world. As we are slowly reclaming our status as a regional great power, we must reform our bureaucracy and prepare it for the governance of vast territories that are about to come under our sovereignty."
 mvareform: "Westernize the Administration"
 mvareform_desc: "Our current administration is centuries outdated and traces back to the times when Moravia was more of a tribal federation than an organized kingdom. It should be in our best interest to reform it based on the western example."

 andalusian_caliphate_desc: "Since the disintegration of the Umayyad Caliphate, Andalusia has proudly stood as the spiritual leader of the Islamic world. Even though there are many who claim the Caliphate, only our claim to it is a legitimate one."
 aduceremonial: "Ceremonial Nobility"
 aduceremonial_desc: "After our victory at Balansiyah, treasonous emirs attempted to overthrow the Caliph, having grown far too powerful to handle with subtlety. Although ultimately defeated, such traitors would be likely to cause trouble later if permitted to maintain their power and influence. By stripping these powerful magnates of their titles and lands and granting them to persons who are still loyal, the position of emir will be henceforth ceremonial."
 aducolonial: "Reform the Overseas Administration"
 aducolonial_desc: "Our growing colonial empire requires an administrative reform which will strengthen our grip over the oversea territories and attract new settlers to move to the New World."
 aduprovincial: "Reform the Provincial System"
 aduprovincial_desc: "Under the Ummayad Caliphate, lands were granted to generals and other such influential persons as hereditary titles. This caused disloyalty later as the nobles expanded their provincial dominance. The creation of a meritocratic system in our provinces whereby loyal and competent men can rise through the ranks in lieu of indulgent wastrels may accomplish this goal."
 aduawasim: "New Thughur and Awasim"
 aduawasim_desc: "The Thughur were a series of marches, comprised of fortified strongholds on the Byzantine frontier. The Awasim were then emplaced in Syria as a secondary line of defence. During the 8th and 9th centuries, more Thughur and Awasim were created on the northern border to protect against the Franks and other Christian kingdoms. By effectively reviving this system, newly conquered territories ought to be more easily-defended, ensuring the security of Andalusia’s core lands."
 aduforeignscholar: "Invite Foreign Scholars"
 aduforeignscholar_desc: "During the Andalusian Golden Age in the 10th and 11th, centuries many scholars flocked from across Europe and the Islamic World to visit the Umayyad Caliphate’s famous universities and libraries. By enacting a programme of systematic renovation and use of excess tax revenue to fund the founding of new Universities, the Caliphate may handily entice learned men to once more study in Al-Andalus."
 adulegalsystem: "Reform the Legal System"
 adulegalsystem_desc: "For most of its history Al-Andalus had a very advanced legal system for its time. However due to centuries of neglect this system has grown old and somewhat corrupt. By changing the system of choosing Qadis (judges) and creating a proper judicial authority we can create a modernised legal system."
 aduconstitution: "Andalusian Constitution"
 aduconstitution_desc: "Across Europe movements of revolution are spreading, some advocate for reform, and some even want the end of hereditary rule! Although, some of their ideas are way too radical, one of them is the establishment of a constitution clarifying the powers of the ruler. Instead of denying all of their ideas we should hear them out and implement some of them. This has the benefit of satisfying their demands and reducing the number of radicals in these revolutionary groups."

 nizzarid_dynasty: "Nizzarid Stratocracy"
 nizzarid_dynasty_desc: "The Nizzarid Sultanate is truly an anomaly in the world; a state built to sustain an army, which in and of itself exists solely to serve its dynastic sovereign. Indeed, while the position of Sultan is an inherited one, the Crown Prince must serve with distinction and earn the army's respect, lest they lose a significant amount of internal support."
 ability_nizzarid_interaction_mechanic: "Nizzarid Interactions"
 nazcavalry: "New Hetairoi Cavalry"
 nazcavalry_desc: "Alexander the Great, the renowned Greek warrior-king from Antiquity, has been the focal point of a Nizzarid cult of personality since the dynasty's founding. Through imitating history's greatest conqueror and his father Philip II, whilst also appeasing the abundant population of Copts in Egypt by offering high ranking military employment, the establishing of an elite cavalry force based directly upon the Argead Hetairoi cavalry is deemed a necessary investment."
 nazcoptic: "Coptic Intelligentsia"
 nazcoptic_desc: "The Coptic people are among the last remaining descendants of the Old Egyptians and their Greco-Roman overlords, and thus maintain an important position within the Nizzarid hierarchy. In no small part due to their significant population within Egypt's borders, the Coptic leadership must be placated with extravagant titles and a place in high society. By composing the bureaucratic and learned classes, the Copts' legacy will truly be honoured to its fullest."
 nazsecularism: "Premodern Secularism"
 nazsecularism_desc: "The Nizzarid state is one which functions - in no small part - due to the high tolerance towards the various religions and cultures under its rule. Some have gone so far as to accuse the Sultanate of heresy for effectively separating clerical and governing bodies, but they pulled fleece over their own eyes. The Nizzarids shall not risk denying Egypt's pre-Islamic heritage and people, instead weaving them into the fabric of the new state as equals."
 nazcaliph: "Puppet Caliph"
 nazcaliph_desc: "The Nizzarid Sultanate is on paper be ruled by a Muslim dynasty, with a sizeable Muslim population ekeing out a slim majority over the Copts. Contrary to what may otherwise be assumed, though, Nizzar's Egypt is one of unprecedented cultural and religious tolerance and syncretism. Despite this, their ongoing diplomatic and trade rivalry with neighbouring Islamic powers has necessitated a certain... compromise. Lo and behold, the Abbasid dynasty, having fled Baghdad in the wake of the Mongol invasions, have made Cairo their home. Ultimately puppets of the Sultan residing in a gilded cage, the mere presence of the Abbasids nonetheless affords the House of Nizzar much prestige in both a political and spiritual sense."
 naznomarchy: "Restored Nomarchy"
 naznomarchy_desc: "The Egyptian kingdom has for most of its history been viewed as a union of two lands; Upper and Lower Egypt. After the Ptolemaic period the lands were further divided into administrative districts referred to as Nomes, which were governed by a Nomarch. With the Nizzarid state's need to further improve state function and their dogged syncretism of pre and post-Arab customs, an overhauled system based on the Nomarchy of old may be just what we need."
 nazarab: "Arab Trade Caravans"
 nazarab_desc: "As shrewd traders and rugged travelers, Arabs perform the lion's share of commerce work in the Nizzarid state. With their unrivalled knowledge of desert traversal and a variety of exotic goods to exchange, the economy of Egypt will once more become peerless; the Pearl of the Near East. May our coffers never go empty again!"
 nazmamluks: "Mamluks under Heel"
 nazmamluks_desc: "The Mamluks, the warrior-slave caste, have been none too cooperative - even with the luxuries afforded to them by a tolerant administration. While the Copts, Arabs, and other "free" groups have caused no trouble thusfar, the new generations of Mamluks are a magazine ready to detonate. The corvee system of old must be reworked and the role of the Mamluks in Egyptian harshly curbed, lest we end up weak like the Ayyubids. Through the gradual Egyptification and immediate disarmament of these slaves, they may yet learn their place in a Nizzarid world. They would evidently serve a better purpose improving infrastructure and agriculture while not at war, being granted permanent wages when called to act as fodder in our battles."
 nazmaat: "Ma'at and Kenbet"
 nazmaat_desc: "In New Kingdom Egypt, the concepts of justice, order, right, and wrong were encompassed by the concept of Ma'at. Though named after an Infidel "goddess", the idea itself may bear some weight in the reformed Nizzarid legal code. By implementing morality and common sense-based laws adapted from Ma'at, we can then arbitrate legal issues under Kenbets; courts run by village elders and - in extreme cases - the Vizier, or His Majesty himself. This would permit a decentralised justice system which would nonetheless be under the Sultan's thumb."

 swewesternize: "Integration of the Heathens"
 swewesternize_desc: "Our wars against the great heathen armies of Denmark, Norway, and Finland have brought under us many pagan subjects who still are very much like us. As we integrate these new territories, we must ensure our state is properly equipped to bring these heathens into the fold. By rewarding those who convert with bureaucratic integration, we may expedite the process of assimilation and administration."

 sweleidang_desc: "Leidang is a form of conscription organising a coastal fleet with the aim of defence, coerced trade, plunderings, and aggressive wars. This system forms one of the pillars of our naval power and defense of our coastlines and should be further reinforced so that our naval borders are always safe."
 sweriksdag: "Riksdag of the Estates"

 bricavalry: "Adopt the Frankish Cavalry"
 bricavalry_desc: "Even though we are bitter rivals of the Frankish Latinization which is being imposed upon us, we should be more open to the positive aspects of their realm; such as their masterful use of heavy cavalry. Adopting their tactics would greatly benefit our armies and increase the effectivenness of the cavalry on the battlefield."
 briparliament: "Parliament of Brittany"
 briparliament_desc: "Even if our policies are rightful, our subjects look for representation. Lest discontent boil into open rebellion, we may consider devolving the monarch's absolute authority by drafting a constitution which, among other things, would grant the commons their own legislative assembly."

 saxon_england_desc: "The Ænglish Monarchy is a representative monarchy, with a parliament called regularly by the ruling monarch. It is based on the privileges defined in Witangemot Reformation."
 witenred: "Witenred"
 witenred_desc: "The Witenagemot was much too burdensome a beast to handle, with many centuries worth of turmoil that bears burden of proof. Thus, His Majesty put into effect what is arguably Ængland's first Constitution. A charter of basic liberties and rights of the nobility and commonfolk has been codified into Crown Law, as well as the establishment of the Witenred; the Wisemen's Council. Replacing the Witenagemot, this is a permanent legislative body which convenes around the Great Round Table at Wintanceastre on a regular basis. By determining matters of state under the guidance of the Cyning or his proxy and enforcing greater regulations to curb aristocratic autonomy, a degree of accountability is to be upheld."

 enghousecarls: "Housecarls"
 enghousecarls_desc: "The Housecarls have long served as bodyguards for Ængland's royalty, ever since the days of Svein Forkbeard and Cnut the Great, and thus hold a significant level of prominence among High Society. From the lowest street urchin to the most pampered son of an Earl, the chance to have His Majesty's ear, a plot of land, and a fixed salary is nothing to be scoffed at. Veterans of the Varangian Guard returning to Ængland are granted the closest seats to the Cyning due to their combat experience, with the tradition of gaining combat experience as a mercenary abroad taking precedence over simple recruitment or post-army specialisation. This ensures that most Housecarls are well and truly ready to thwart any threat to their liege, no matter how overwhelming it may be."
 engenglisc: "Standardized Ænglish"
 engenglisc_desc: "The Ænglish language is rapidly evolving, with an ever-expanding number of loan words from across the Channel, the Scots, and beyond. In order to prevent mutually unintelligible dialects in the future, and to better accomodate diplomatic and administrative tasks, a common tongue must be constructed. The Cyning's Ænglish will be considered mandatory to learn by the educated classes, eventually overtaking the churls' many spoken Ænglish variants. No more shall there be an Ænglaland, Ænglalond, and Ængland, nor an Anglisc, Ænglisc, and Ængelisc. Henceforth, there will always be an Ængland, which speaks and writes the Cyning's Ænglish."
 engchronicle: "Church Chroniclers"
 engchronicle_desc: "The Ængelcynn Church is one of the most important institutions within Ængland, overseeing ecclesiastical matters under the Cyning's oversight. The best-educated of the people of Ængland, short of the nobility, the clergymen are responsible for documenting every aspect of the realm for both posterity and improvement. Their role shall be expanded so that travelling scholars will receive Crown funding, in exchange for adding to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle with information both historical and political. Furthermore, the most learned men will be kept in the Cyning's company, so as to note down every facet of court life and the duties of rulership during each reign. Although such court chroniclers have been around for an untold many years, their role is now more vital than ever for capturing the essence of what is Ængland, and they have a fancy new title to show for it."
 engheptarch: "The Late Heptarchy"
 engheptarch_desc: "The Heptarchs are the most powerful men of Ængland, each ruling over one of the seven administrative divisions of the country as theoretical equals to one another while swearing fealty to the Cyning. What works on paper, however, rarely if ever does so in practice. The Heptarchs have grown too powerful and too dangerous, each knowing full well that any one of them could be the next Cyning of Ængland. Despite this, they have also fallen into a great deal of debt to the Crown. By leveraging the economically dire straits of the six lords not on the throne, a number of laws can be instituted by which they shall be brought under heel. Deprived of the right to field their own military forces and police, forced to pay annual taxes to the Crown once again, and ceding all lands not directly part of residential estates to the Crown, the Heptarchs will no longer be a conceivable danger to anyone. That is, to anyone but themselves."
 engcyning: "The Cyning's Witan"
 engcyning_desc: "Semi-constitutional monarchy has served its purpose in Ængland well enough, but outstayed its welcome nonetheless. The Crown's power gradually devolved yet again, albeit this time into the hands of the Earls, Yeomen, and Churls rather than Heptarchs. Through lessons learnt, it is clear that all the power of the state must be concentrated into the Cyning's authority. The Witen shall no longer hold legislative duties as they did in the Gemot or the Red which succeeded it; their post is to be one of an advisory nature, but permanent through and through. His Majesty shall rule with an iron, but fair, fist and the people shall celebrate him all the more for it. An enlightened monarch in an enlightened time, surrounded by enlightened men. God Save the Cyning!"
 enghereditary: "The Hereditary Succession Act"
 enghereditary_desc: "The Ænglish throne has never officially been a hereditary post, with the monarchical candidates being derived from the Heptarchs upon the death of the Cyning-regnant. This of course has its benefits, but a most notable increase in political turmoil leading up to Coronation Day is not helped by the lack of defined succession. The ever-growing irrelevance of the Witen outside of their role as royal advisors has also made the tradition of selecting a Cyning's successor somewhat of a humiliating affair for all involved. A radical new bill known as the Hereditary Succession Act shall abolish the last vestiges of the Witen's influence and furthermore the bastardised elective system within Ængland. No more shall riled churls question whether they, too, could reign if it is succession by vote. There is only one bloodline fit to sit on the throne, and its right to rule has been ordained by both the law and God's will."

Drawing recruits largely from the rugged coastal settlements, there have never been hardier men in all the realm to stand vigilant against foreign aggression. This can be supplemented even further by modernising warship designs and further refining maritime training; for the Wooden Wall to spread from Dover to Calen. Both man and ship shall have unwavering hearts of oak, so they may fight and conquer time and again."
 engcompany: "Ænglish Colonial Companies"

Our nomadic ancestors traveled on their backs with their flocks of sheep, goats and cattle over the immense plains of Mongolia and Central Asia. In times of war, the horses carried our men to numerous victories and even the greatest Khagans of the past ruled their vast empires on the horseback.

 #Jurchen
 mch_clansociety: "Clan Society"
 mch_clansociety_desc: "The Jurchen tribes often organize via various levels of clan affiliation, ranging from the Muku sub-clans to ancient and extensive Hala clans, or even the companies or squadrons formed for local affairs. Family, war, and even daily activities involve some level of clan formation, not even necessarily by blood. We must ensure the role of these clan divisions are not forgotten in our society so that we may rule with efficiency."
 mch_tengri: "Jurchen Shamanism"
 mch_tengri_desc: "Jurchen shamanistic traditions typically revolve around ancestor worship and veneration of nature spirits via altars called Tangse. Not all altars were permanent, but in many settled communities, the Tangse were permanent fixtures where offerings were made. Ancestors also play a major role in shamanic tradition, as they are believed to be the protective spirits of a village who are contacted by shamans via totem poles, or Somo. By ensuring these practices continue and our shamans are respected, society will remain strong and cohesive."
 mch_nestorian: "Nestorian Syncretism"
 mch_nestorian_desc: "With the arrival of the Temugids came an influx of Nestorian scholars, bureaucrats, and clergymen to Manchuria. A majority of these foreigners remained settled in Liaoning where they serve the Temugid court, but some moved north and settled within our communities looking for missionary work or a new life. While they may practice a foreign religion that preaches radically different ideas, these are learned men who bring their knowledge from the Silk Road with them, and our people could benefit greatly from allowing the Nestorians a special status in society."
 mch_buddhist: "Eastern Syncretism"
 mch_buddhist_desc: "Our people have had centuries of experience with the religious practices of Buddhism and Confucian ideals from China. It has served us well to treat these faiths as equals among our shamanistic traditions, as they bring connections from across China and the steppes, and it would be wise to protect the status of these faiths in our government alongside our own beliefs."
 mch_admin: "Jin Administration"
 mch_admin_desc: "One of the most successful reforms of our Jin predecessors was the implementation of separate government structures for all its subjects. Every culture and ethnic group had a recognized status and dealt with the Jin via their own local government, and often even had a regional Jin capital. We must adopt this tradition once again in order to rule all manner of peoples effectively as we begin our ascenscion."
 mch_jin: "Legacy of our Ancestors"
 mch_jin_desc: "Arguably the height of our people was the establishment of the Jurchen Jin dynasty in China. Though the Dynasty collapsed with the rise of the Mongols, our conquests and continued survival has given us the chance to reclaim what the Jin once held. As we lay the groundwork for our great state, let us remember what is possible from the accomplishments our ancestors."
 #Shogunate
 japansakoku: "Strengthen the Sakoku"
 japansakoku_desc: "Although the Shogun is Japan's de facto ruler, the regime is not absolute. The Shogunate must thus ensure that his daimyo do not succumb to forigen influences, which may instigate rebellion. Henceforth, Japan shall be closed off, save for only a few areas directly under our clan's control."
 japantenryotax: "Tax the Tenryo"
 japantenryotax_desc: "In Japan, owned land is seen as the source of one's wealth, with all currency based upon how much rice it can produce. From now on, the Shogunate shall seek to obtain as much land for our clan as possible, and tax it appropriately."
 japanshinsengumi: "Form the Shinsengumi"
 japanshinsengumi_desc: "The Shinsengumi, or New Select Brigade, is the Shogunate's most recent experiment in policing. The recruits have been drawn from many sword schools across the capital, with the mission of protecting Shogunate officials from dissenters. Should these men prove themselves, they will set a new precedent for the Bakufu's military police."
 japanbakuhan: "Establish the Bakuhan System"
 japanbakuhan_desc: "Despite being the hegemon of Japan, the Shogunate must ensure that the Daimyo remain loyal. To this end, the regime shall ensure that the Bakufu's various Han are headed by pliable Daimyo. From making annual trips to the capital, to retaining only a single fort, and even subjecting their own territories to land reforms, the Shogun shall ensure that his feudal vassals are perpetually incapable of revolt."
 japanredseal: "Issue the Red Seal Ships"
 japanredseal_desc: "In the past, we were content to merely let the individual clans engage in trade, oftentimes at their own discretion. In order to cut down on corruption, foreign influence, and seditious trade activities, the Shogun shall regulate all commercial activities through the issuing of Red Seal permits. This policy will finally allow us to both control and centralise Japan's trade."

We will increase our focus on naval developement and reform our navy."
 feourban: "Urbanize the Steppe"
 feourban_desc: "Even if our core region is very developed with cities and blooming trade ports, our scouts have reported that the steppes around us have really small activity because of the nomadic lifestyle of the Tatars. Once we expand into the steppes, we can raise Gothic cities and develop these lands to be the new jewels on our crown that is Gothia."

As such, our rulers come close to what Plato described as the Philosopher Kings, in that they hold with them the humanist values of ethics and morality as well as knowledge of the natural world."

As the Seljuk Empire, we collected  tribute from Smyrna to Khorasan in our golden era but lost our influence after our collapse. The Double-Headed Eagle has awoken from its slumber and will collect its tributes back - or else."
 seldiwan: "Modernize the Diwan"
 seldiwan_desc: "Our great empire looked back to the Göktürks and got inspiration from their institution of the Kurultai. Modernizing and expanding it to meet demands, the Diwan was created. Forming the central government, it hosts exclusive topics in the specified assemblies where the Sultan can organize the government, send executive orders and listen to feedback from the populace and the governors. With trusted and skilled bureaucrats holding positions such as the Vizier that acts as a subordinate to the Sultan, the Diwan is the ideal for a pluralist decision-making and governing system. Rally the mushrif, call the Emirs and the first session of Diwan-i Ala shall commence!"
 selkanun: "Issue the Kanun"
 selkanun_desc: "The Kanun, meaning The Law, will be the scripture of our state's bureaucracy and courts. Acting as a central constitution, it will have the final say in every affair considering things such as crime, war, public safety, government policies and other situations. The Turks were once known for their organization in the steppes and we will continue this expansion of the governance."
 selturkmen: "Turkmen Mercenaries"
 selturkmen_desc: "With their amber horses, battle-hardened steel swords, jammed pistols stolen from the enemy and a loyal Baglama to sing and play folk songs, the Turkmens are a group of Turks who settled in Anatolia. They mostly live a semi-nomadic lifestyle and profit off of animal husbandry, banditry and conscription. With their brave hearts and battle experience, they can serve as excellent mercenaries for the Seljuk Empire." 
 seldeli: "Expand the Deli Units"
 seldeli_desc: "The Delis in our army act as costume-wearing, intimidating mascots to scare the weak heathen forces that cross our way. Expanding their position from morale boosting mascots to frontline marching special units will give a boost in confidence to our troops, intimidating the enemy with their unique costumes while marching, chanting spells and war cries."
 selsecularization: "Secularization of the Legal System"
 selsecularization_desc: "We are a great empire that hosts a lot of different religions and cultures. Our core ethnic group, the Turks, are Sunni Muslim but a sizeable portion of our blood brothers also believe in the Christian faith and the Persian god. In bureucracy, the favoritism of Sunni Islam blocks the state from prospering the heathen population even of our own people. By secularizing the legal system, we will solve the religious divide between our subjects while  creating room for further tolerance and recruitment of non-Sunni citizens of the empire. With no religious favoritism and a tolerant society, expansion of our empire into heathen lands will be much easier."
 selappoint: "Create Autonomous Appanages"
 selappoint_desc: "Our empire is ever expanding and to rule an entity this grand and sublime, we need Appanages to rule certain titles to divide management and put less work on the central government and give  the affairs of taxation, conscription and governence to our appanages to further develop our new titles. The appanages will be the descendents of our dynasty which would make them less leaning to revolt. Genghis Khan has ruled Asia with no effort using this system, so we should take inspiration."

If we do not act aggressively, preemptively striking out at our insolent and unruly neighbours, we will be relegated to mere scholarly history, wiped from the face of the map as many of our predecessors and brethren have.

 nicene_agoge_desc: "The Agoge was a harsh education and training program designed to prepare the Spartan youth for adulthood and military service, it lasted from the age of 7 to the age of 19, although officialy it wouldnt end until the participant was 29. During the period of this rigorous training young boys learned to fight, to build, to socialize, to love their country and so much more, it guaranteed that the seeds of the next generation were the best they could be.\n\nBy copying the program and changing some of its features to fit our situation we could implement it and reap massive benefits as our citizens would become better, stronger and smarter then the citizens of any other country."
 nicene_abolish: "Abolish the Patriarchate"
 nicene_abolish_desc: "The Patriarchate of Constantinople is far too dangerous to our rule, it's obvious to us now that the current patriarch should have been imprisoned if not straight up executed when our armies marched into the City of the World's Desire, and his position dismantled then and there. \n But instead we hesitated to even touch this holy figure, someone who means so much to most of our populace, and as a consequence he lingered around, poisoning the minds and hearts of Constantinople if not all of Greece, convincing them that the destruction of the Byzantine pretenders was a tragedy, that they were conquered by foreigners from Anatolia who want to wipe out their Roman identity. \n \n It is time we acknowledge the reality of how dangerous the position is and put an end to this circus, so that nothing remains that can challange the re-hellenization of Greece."
 nicene_control: "Control the Patriarchate"
 nicene_control_desc: "Despite the Roman nonsense the Patriarchs are so eager to spew into the minds of our citizens, perhaps we can tighten our control over them and ensure that instead of being a harmful element to our legitimacy, they can instead bolster our popularity and control over the European Greeks by accepting de-romanization and preaching the good words of our leaders.\n \nWe can achieve that goal by slowly and quietly eliminating the Patriarchate's influence over the the local churches of Greece while also giving token compensations to the Church instead, we shall also delegate more authority over matters of faith to local presbyters and priests to weaken the Patriarchs control while earning favours with the rest of the holy Orthodox church."
 nicene_diarchy: "Introduce Diarchy"

Of course this has some legislative drawbacks but what doesn't? If implemented right this could elevate our state above the fear of incompetency."

 wee_confederation: "Wendish Confederation"
 wee_confederation_desc: "For centuries, the Polabian Slavs lived in various loose federations which lacked any central government, and thus were greatly divided, making them an easy pray for the Germanic invaders.

As an important commodity, sometimes dubbed "the gold of the north", amber was transported from the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts overland by way of the Vistula and Dnieper rivers to Italy, Greece, the Black Sea, Syria and Egypt over a period of thousands of years. However, the wars between the Pagan and Christian world have greatly disrupted the trade and the Amber Road was reduced into insignificance.

 tataria_nobility: "Tatar Nobility"

 tataria_aristocracy: "Mongol Aristocracy"
 tataria_aristocracy_desc: "The ruling class of the Golden Horde is still largely composed of descendants of the Kiyat, the Manghud, Sicivut, and the Khongirad clans of the Mongols.

 tataria_meritocracy: "Eastern Meritocracy"
 tataria_meritocracy_desc: "When Genghis Khan swept across Asia and established his empire, one of his most notable reforms was promoting government officials based on their actual talent, rather than connections. He also made sure to promote administrative diversity, assigning different peoples across the empire to govern regions far from home. His reforms saw great success, and a similar method can be implemented in our new Kingdom."
 tataria_kurultai: "Reform the Kurultai"
 tataria_kurultai_desc: "The Kurultai is an old Mongol and Turkic tradition to select new leaders and deliberate over military campaigns, similar to holding a court. It involves all clan leaders attending a physical gathering where there is much festivity and deliberation. During our time as nomads, we continued this tradition to elect our Khans and plan European incursions. However, now that we have settled, the Kurultai would be more useful if it was reshaped into an administrative assembly, given that it already includes the most important rulers of the empire."
 tataria_pasta: "Supremacy of the Pashta"

 ottoman_nizam_desc: "The Osmans have the Jannisaries, the highly-feared elite units that protect Konstantiniyye. Even though they are very effective in combat, their reserves are very low. As a republic that expands and owns bureaus, ports and even cities all around Asia and Europe, we need to create a new, disciplined army made out of citizens. Nizam-i Cedid is born!"
 ottoman_lodge: "The Freeweavers Lodge"
 ottoman_lodge_desc: "Silk is one of the most important trade goods that unite the East and the West. The Christians love the silk imported from the lands of the Jade Emperor, transported via the ships of Arabic traders and sold by the Osman family. To protect the rights of silkweavers all around the world and use this socio-economic monopoly to manipulate diplomatic outcomes to our favor, we will find the Freeweavers Lodge and spread our connections around the world."
 ottoman_eyalets: "Economic Eyalets"
 ottoman_eyalets_desc: "Many nations divide their lands under feudal lords thus limiting the central government's power. In our domain, lands are divided between their economic importances and goods, governed by Valis appointed by Konstantiniyye. With our elections and rightful suzerienity, we are truly heirs to the Rashidun way of governence."
 #Normandy
 ducal_ring: "Ducal Ring of Normandy"
 ducal_ring_desc: "The Ducal Ring of Normandy was created after Rollo's raid on the Kingdom of West Francia during Charles the Fat's reign. This ring for a time was a symbol of the Duke's absolute power and feudal ideology over his nobles, but the duke was not the only sign of authority in his own realm. The Church was the second most powerful within the realm and the ducal ring allowed for the Normans to call upon some of the best knights from these ecclesiastical vassals."
 english_feudal: "English Feudal Monarchy"
 english_feudal_desc: "English Feudalism is a term to consist for the Norman adherence to feudalism brought into the new Norman Kingdom of England. This form of feudalism persists much like the way the Frankish do it, but like in Normandy the power of the nobility is heavily checked by both the power of the crown's estates and the church's estates."
 ang_robertian: "Robertian Reforms"
 ang_robertian_desc: "Robert IV and Robert the V had important impacts to the structure of the Norman military which followed suit into the English military. These reforms became known as the Robertian Structure. This military structure in battle helped the infantry form deadly formations. The Robertian Military Structure was widely regarded as one of the largest and most complex structures of military command in Western Europe and was far superior than the Frankish structure when the Robertian structure was at it's height. Though the structure may fall out of order it still stands as one of the best within Europe. Having generals from afar serving  service while also having a unique infantry, artillery, and officer corp."
 ang_placate: "Retain Anglisc Common Law"
 ang_placate_desc: "Upon our landing in England and our conquest, we have found that most of the nobility and subjects remain Anglo-Saxons. This cultural divide between the Norman nobility and the Anglo-Saxon nobles has led to multiple conflicts within our realm. These conflicts caused threw the King into a dire position. With his realm to his back he has decreed his support with the Anglo-Saxons to lead a more unified Kingdom under a Norman led realm."
 ang_relocate: "Normanisation of the Ealdormen"
 ang_relocate_desc: "With the swift conquest of England our realm lies in tatters between the Old Anglo-Saxons and the new Normans. These two cultures have had rough relations in the past years, with the Anglo-Saxon nobility threatening our position in the Kingdom a decree has been called for the stability of the realm. The Anglo-Saxon nobility must be reduced and this calls for relocating and placating of the Norman Nobility."
 ang_chancery: "Courts of Chancery and Exchequer"
 ang_chancery_desc: "Our government continues to grow and expand beyond what we thought was possible. From our humble duchy of Normandy to the Kingdom of England our realm has found itself in adminsitrative defecits. With the centralization/decentralization of our state we have found that our state has grown too large to be governed effectively by only fiefs and the Royalty. With the Establishment of the Chancery, the King's personal advisors, and documentors the realm shall be able to be governed more efficiently in a greater state allowing the realm to be more prosperous and innovative."
 ang_rule: "Rule Britannia"
 ang_rule_desc: "Our realm is isolated via the English channel, it is fact; However the channel has allowed us to seperate and distance ourselves from Europe with little quarrels. The Channel and Seas on our coast being the first line of defense has required our navy to be top of the line unlike our predecessors. The Anglo-Saxons may have built a 'wooden wall', but it was not the epitome of what it could have been. With the knowledge of history and the finests woods from beyond the seas, and from our backyard, our ships and our navy shall be equipped with the best ships possible along with the best trained sailors we shall train."
 ang_academy: "Royal Military Academy"
 ang_academy_desc: "The Robertian Military Structure served our nation well in the past and with the future rapidly approaching with new technologies and abilities furthering the complexities of warfare this system was rapidly outdated. The General staff of our nation being educated in the largest military acadamey in England, the London School of Warfare/The London Academy of War have produced some of the finest generals in Western European history. The academy also known for updated the outdated Robertian structure also leads in Naval Officers and Naval structures to date, yet the war academy remains one of the most fit in Europe for future generals."
 ang_mixing: "Anglo-Norman Unity"
 ang_mixing_desc: "With the mixing of both the Norman and Anglo-Saxon cultures our advisors the nobility, administrative cadre, and the King's Household have been improved for the administration, economic, and military benefits of the realm. Diplomacy also enhanced for the better projection of our culture as a dominant force worldwide."
 ang_representation: "English Representation"
 ang_representation_desc: "With the idea of populist representation in parliament and the passing of laws through a parlimentary body, the realm has prospered. While of course Military and Diplomatic affairs remain that of the King/Queen skills, the English monarchy have aided in keeping their Kingdom together. The people now allowed to represent their rights has caused most of the noble backlash to be silences as the civilians revel in freedoms and the lower class soon dominating over the noble class in diplomatic sway. Whether for better or worse the effects has been dealt and the parliament has allowed for diplomatic stability. The Representation of our people unifies our realm under one government with multiple forms of representation."
 ang_consolidation: "Consolidation of Power"
 ang_consolidation_desc: "England stands united under the reforms our regime has implemented be it they are unified under fear, love, admiration, or whatever motive they entail our realm is still united. This unity has allowed us to consolidate our power rather quickly making the King the central head of authority within the realm. While this has caused backlash, it allows for less infigting between politics and more importantly it implements the idea: 'one king one state.'"
 ang_charter: "The Royal Charter"
 ang_charter_desc: "With the the Realm united, the realm stands under the king and its people. The road was difficult and the realm once split under two ideologies still stands. The King at the helm with his advisors at hand has lead the nation to glory. The Kingdom of England wether centralized or decentralized through code of law doesn't matter, what matters is that the Monarchy remains adaptable and with many paths to steer forward from. The English law flexible yet strong have been enforced through peace, blood, and honor with the King at the helm and the Judges leading the trials. The law unshakable and the realm so too unshakable the English realm is left guided for the future flexible as always,but No matter the path of which England goes certain ideals remain.

 viking_kingdom: "Viking Kingdom"
 viking_kingdom_desc: "The concept of the 'Viking' - the overseas trader, traveler, and raider - has existed since at least the 700s, and the Danish people themselves are even older. The concept of a 'Viking kingdom', in contrast, is much younger; even so, we have managed to integrate this idea both into Danish society and into Danish government."
 danthralls: "Abolish the Thrall Caste"
 danthralls_desc: "The thralls are a caste of slaves that once existed throughout the Norse kingdoms. While our Swedish brethren - those traitorous swines - may have abolished thralldom upon their conversion to Christianity, both Norway and our own kingdom have not done so yet, given how useful thralls are for rowing our ships. Of course, once thralldom is outlawed, we'll actually have to pay our sailors - for better and for worse."
 dankarls: "Empower the Ceorls"
 dankarls_desc: "In order to ensure a balance of power against the nobles and the warriors, we must entrust more rights and privileges to the ceorls - free citizens within Danish and Viking society. By using these well-educated and hard-working freemen, we shall manage to maintain the political status quo against the nobility of our kingdom."
 danlongships: "Modernize the Longships"
 danlongships_desc: "The longships - otherwise known as the best ships in the entire world - have been, admittedly, relatively outdated for more than three hundred years now. Given that longships compose the bulk of our navy and waterborne transportation, the fact that these ships are obsolete to such a degree is, to say the least, an issue. We must modernize the longship, and we must do so promptly."
 danberserkir: "Reform the Berserkir"
 danberserkir_desc: "The berserkirs are Norse warriors who are known for their ferocity and combat prowess. Unfortunately, these warriors are sometimes so blinded by their own rage that they are unable to tell friend from foe, and are more of a threat to their allies than to their enemies. These issues, combined with their lack of discipline, have had a serious impact on our army. While we cannot completely abolish the berserkir status quo altogether, we must still find ways to enforce greater discipline among them."
 danvikingtrade: "Restore the Old Trade Routes"
 danvikingtrade_desc: "The memories of once-extensive Viking trade routes - renowned for having been some of the most extensive across the entire continent - still linger in the minds of our people. Unfortunately, our traders have been locked out of these routes for quite some time now; clearly, this situation needs to change, and our old trade routes must be restored. Expeditions will be sent out to do so, and our traders will once more reach Constantinople, Baghdad, Kiev, the Isles, and all of Europe!"#Italy
 dancadre: "Military Cadre"
 dancadre_desc: "With conquests and raiding being the heart of the Kingdom, our government and King must reflect this in his ruling. The military cadre of Denmark were advisors to the King to advise him on such military matters and to be some of the best Danish military leaders in the Kingdom."
 danelective: "The Danish Elective"
 danelective_desc: "The Danish elective dates back to the ideals of the Scandinavian electives, all alike. Nobles voted for the heir to their kingdom, fiefdom, or lesser titles. Empowering this institution could lead to better rulers, and placate our largest factions: the free citizens, the military, and the nobility."
 danempower: "Empower the Danish Elective"
 danempower_desc: "The Danish Elective has little control in the eyes of the people, but with the expansion of its power and the King's control the institution looks more legitimate in the eyes of the people. This legitimacy aids in his rule over large swathes of land and people that are within his liability and responsibility, but most importantly it makes the king more legitimate in the eyes of the nobles and people which hold immense power."
 danrigsdagen: "Found the Rigsdagen"
 danrigsdagen_desc: "The Rigsdagen is a foundation of a political basis for the Kingdom's debates and laws to be made. The Rigsdagen is overlooked by the King and has an elective representative elected by the Ceorls. The formation of such an institution is to solidify the separation of power between the King, the people, and the nobility."

 iretara_desc: "The Aire are the traditional nobles of our realm, entrusted with the task of proclaiming the ascension of each high King when the time comes. Let us reorganise this ceremonial body into a legitimate council that will meet at the hill of Tara not just to crown the king but also to deliberate on governmental matters."

 ireadmin: "Dóernemed in Administration"
 ireadmin_desc: "The Dóernemed are a class of skilled craftsmen, merchants, and businessmen within Ireland. Along with the agricultural majority, they have a considerable role in upholding our economy.

 itaempowermerchants: "Empower Italian Merchants"
 itaempowermerchants_desc: "The decline of Constantinople has left a void in the eastern Mediterranean and allowed our entrepreneurs many opportunities to gain fame and fortune trading with the east. We should grant these new great merchant families special privileges and status, with the hopes that they use they're wealth and trade knowledge to improve the realm."
 itafederation: "Federazione dei Regni"
 itafederation_desc: "Our recent consolidation of Italy has left us with the question of what to do with all of the old realms we have absorbed. By forming a federation with these old states, we can streamline the process of building a new realm while retaining stability."
 itacursus: "Cursus Honorum"
 itacursus_desc: "By calling on the old Roman system of cursus honorum, or ladder of offices, a system in which prospective bureaucrats must achieve a specific order of public offices before being granted important roles we can hope to improve the efficiency and competency of our whole administration."
 itaformalize: "Formalize Condottiere Corps"
 itaformalize_desc: "Constant conflict among the northern Italian states has led to a large number of mercenary companies in the region, led by the formidable condottiere. By establishing them as a legitimate group in our country, with their own rights and privileges and formalizing their training, we can create an effective and strong leadership for our armies."
 itanavali: "Arsenali Navali"
 itanavali_desc: "Ever since the days of Trajan and before, Italy has been home to many maritime arsenals that have granted us control over the Mediterranean. By promoting these areas as established military centers we can continue this proud tradition."
 itacatena: "Catena del Castello"
 itacatena_desc: "Due to Italy's precarious situation, constant raids and threats from the heathens in the south, and opportunistic Franks and Germans to the north, we have developed a strong tradition of fortification and our lands are dotted with many castles. Even with our newly unified kingdom, our enemies have not changed, it is time to establish a chain of castles, beacons, and forts along our coast and border - to discourage any would be attacker."
 itacardinal: "Cardinal Bureaucrats"
 itacardinal_desc: "Catholicism originated in Italy, and it's roots run deep through her population, not only does the church has a massive influence on the lives of all proper Christians, but it also has an efficient and formalized bureaucracy that we can draw on for our administration. These Cardinal-Administrators will calm our people, weed out heretics and heathens, and stabilize the realm."
 itaitalianization: "Italianization"
 itaitalianization_desc: "Italy is has not been unified in quite some time, and most of our country does not view itself as Italian, but simply as what city or region they come from. The time has come to do away with this, and this will be done by eliminating local dialects in education and administration, creating common laws for the whole country, removing local powerful families, and destroying regional power structures. Through this great effort, we can hope to establish a unified national identity for our whole country."
 itaromano: "Foro Romano"
 itaromano_desc: "It is time we allow more representation in our government, by organizing open forums inspired by the Roman senate of old, we can hope to inspire a higher degree of participation and hopefully competence in our government."
 itadominus: "Revive the Dominus"
 itadominus_desc: "The title Dominus or master is a old roman title, used particularly by the later emperors, that denotes supreme and divine power. As times are changing it has become more apparent that we need our monarch to play a central role in all matters of the state. Let us reestablish the title and authority that comes with it to strengthen ourselves in these trying times."

 #Scotland
 scomonarchy: "Scots Monarchy"
 scomonarchy_desc: "The King of Scots, while a monarch, does not rule alone. The Parliament, made up of the three estates; the Nobility, the Clergy and the Burghers, advises the sovereign in matters of war, justice, and legislation. Likewise the King cannot levy taxes without the Parliament’s Approval, and its sister institution, the General Council, also plays a vital role in the running of the Kingdom, especially during times of royal incapacity."
 scolairds: "Suppress the Lairds"
 scolairds_desc: "For centuries, the rowdy Highlander nobility has been a continual thorn in the Kingdom’s side, maintaining far too much autonomy from the state. This unseemly situation has been allowed to go on for too long. To curb their influence, many influential clans have had their lands seized and titles given to Lowland nobles, far more loyal to central authority."
 scoschiltron: "Modernising the Schiltron"
 scoschiltron_desc: "There is nothing that quite puts fear in the hearts of an English soldier like the lockstep march of a Scottish Schiltron. But, as gunpowder changes the face of warfare in Europe and elsewhere, the Schiltron requires adaptation to gunpowder tactics. By melding the Schiltron with pike-and-shot tactics, we can ensure the safety of our arquebusiers on the field of battle and ensure the tradition of the Schiltron lives on for many years to come."
 scopower: "Ecclesiastical Power"
 scopower_desc: "The clergy of Scotland have long had an influential, albeit unofficial, role in our administration. Making this relationship official, and extending further secular power to our Bishops and Archbishops will please them immensely, whilst allowing the state greater oversight over our powerful religious institutions."
 scoconvention: "Convention of the Estates"
 scoconvention_desc: "The General Council, the sister institution to the Parliament, has long had overlapping powers with them, and contests between the two bodies over jurisdiction have often caused administrative deadlock. By reforming the General Council into the Convention of the Estates, we can ensure the primacy of Parliament, while allowing the Estates to convene as a separate advisory board."
 sconemo: "Nemo Me Impune Lacessit"
 sconemo_desc: "Over time, Parliament has grown ever more powerful at the expense of the Crown. The Monarch cannot become a figurehead and by balancing the power of the King and Parliament, we can ensure that representatives do not overstep their bounds and trample on the royal prerogative."
 scocourt: "High Court of Justiciary"
 scocourt_desc: "To oversee our enormous judicial system, we have implemented two supreme courts. The first deals with criminal matters, and the second with civil cases. Both have oversight on matters of great public and constitutional importance, acting as the final say on the interpretation of the law to ensure that the justice system is efficient and legitimate."
 #Wales
 wls_privileges: "Redefined Cymydau Privileges"
 wls_privileges_desc: "The kingdom is organised into 'cymydau' - divisions of land, ruled over by individual chieftains responsible for dispensing justice and defensive organisation. For centuries, this manorial practice has ensured a fine-tuned agrarian society, but as of late, the local chieftains have grown dissatisfied with questions such as 'peasant rights' and 'fairness'. Let us clearly define to them what they can and can't do and redefine the cymydau for both their benefit and ours."
 wls_rule: "Rule by Brenhinoedd"
 wls_rule_desc: "For the extent of our history, we have favoured decentralised rule - rule specifically by lesser kings, chieftains and nobles organised beneath one paramount ruler. Our values concerning mutual respect between subject and ruler have permeated our society and its government."
 wls_aristocracy: "Warrior Aristocracy"
 wls_aristocracy_desc: "Over the centuries, we have cultivated a range of values we desire in our rulers and their noble servants. Legitimacy is founded on either military proficiency or firm dynastic inheritance - ensuring stability and marked military professionalism. Wisdom, perfectionism, wealth, just leadership and an affinity for Christian morality - these are the values of our people, especially our aristocrats and military brass."
 wls_honour: "Administration of Honour"
 wls_honour_desc: "Our decentralised realm, organised as it is into the cymydau, is ruled by a great many chieftains, many related directly to our ruling family - who work tirelessly to carry out the whims of our complex law, ancient in nature. Thus, our administration depends heavily upon honour, loyalty and the prerequisites with which these chieftains are granted power - granting us a certain legitimacy and efficiency."
 wls_rheol: "Rheol Uchel"
 wls_rheol_desc: "In an era of rapid change, we have returned more powerful than ever - the Welsh tongue, banner and blood fated to stain Europe for centuries to come. Our powerful aristocracy, fearsome warrior honour and extensive family, entrenched as it is within our administration, has made of our realm one of the prestigious monarchies in the world - and we intend to uphold that reputation by empowering not only the king, but also his chieftains, guided by a strict legal code."
 #Alba
 albadual: "Alban Dual Monarchy"
 albadual_desc: "The King of Alba is, in truth, the King of two distinct nations; the Kingdom of the Gaels and the Kingdom of the Scots. To unite the two peacefully, we have taken measures to allow distinct autonomy regarding their respective legal systems and obligations to the Crown. Alba additionally has three capitals: Scone, where the King is crowned; Dunfermline, where the royal residence is; and Edinburgh, where Parliament convenes.\n\n§YSpecial Mechanic:§!\nEnables Tanistry Heir Selection."
 albalaw: "Scots and Gaelic Law"
 albalaw_desc: "In the conception of Alba under Edgar II, the Gaels and Scots were ruled under entirely separate legal systems. Unfortunately, this has proven relatively inefficient; instead, we have created a unified judicial code for all Alba while leaving allowances for regional differences."
 albahigh: "Highlander Regiments"
 albahigh_desc: "Despite its smaller population, the Highlands provide the bulk of Alba’s manpower. In addition, the Gaels have a unique martial culture that we will foster by having separate Highlands and Lowlands regiments."
 albaunified: "Unified Parliament"
 albaunified_desc: "In the system of our Dual Monarchy, the Highlanders have had the privilege of electing the Tanist, while the Lowlanders have had the privilege of making up the parliamentary body. This has increasingly caused friction between the two; instead, we have united the two in Parliament, establishing parliamentary seats in the Highlands and transferring the election of the Tanist to parliament, so that both Gaels and Scots might have a say on the matter."
 albaunion: "Union of the Crowns"
 albaunion_desc: "Previously the King of Alba’s official title has been King of Scots and Gaels, designating the two peoples as disparate nations. As time has marched on, however, the two peoples have, despite their differences, begun to see themselves as only one people; the Albans. This has now become official, as the King is now known only as the King of Alba."
 albtricameral: "Tricameral Parliament"
 albtricameral_desc: "Many nations’ legislatures are split into distinct chambers; most, however, are split in two. For a long time, this has been true of Alba, with the House of Commons as the lower chamber and the House of Lords as the upper chamber. To break down the separation between the nobles and commons, a third House has been established that consists of the members of both the Upper and Lower chambers."
 #Gaeldom
 gaelmonarchy: "Gaelic Monarchy"
 gaelmonarchy_desc: "The Gaelic King is not simply an office passed from father to son as is practised in other European monarchies. All male members of the reigning clan are entitled to put themselves forward for nomination as the Tanist, the heir to the throne. This position is elected by large swathes of the nobility, ensuring the legitimacy of the monarch and allowing for some measure of meritocracy in the government.\n\n§YSpecial Mechanic:§! Enables Tanistry heir selection"
 gaelclan: "Strengthening the Clan System"
 gaelclan_desc: "The system of Clans is the bedrock that our government is built upon, and unfortunately, it is largely defined by vague precedent and interpersonal oaths rather than well-defined law. It is high time for this to change. We will set out a well-defined set of privileges and responsibilities for the different clans, and ensure that no more squabbling over border disputes is allowed to take place."
 gaelgallow: "Modernising the Gallowglass"
 gaelgallow_desc: "With the advent of gunpowder as a primary feature of warfare, we must ensure that the Gallowglass regiments that make up the bulk of our army are well-trained in the use of firearms. Many who have served as mercenaries on the continent have already been familiarised with gunpowder weaponry, and they will lead the charge in training in the use of firearms."
 gaelcruinneachadh: "Cruinneachadh"
 gaelcruinneachadh_desc: "For much of Gaelic history the Chiefs of various clans, both major and minor, have played an important role in advising the King and building consensus on matters of government. Cruinneachadh, the gathering of the Chiefs, will be legally formalised as an advisory body to the King."
 gaelaon: "Aon Eaglais, Aon Righ, Aon Rioghachd"
 gaelaon_desc: "One Church, One King, One Kingdom. The King rules not only by the assent of the Clans, through the Tanistry, but by the grace of God. Once the King has been chosen by the Clans, it is not then the privilege of the Clans to tell the King what he can and cannot do with the power they have vested in him, only to advise and obey."
 gaeautonomy: "Autonomy of the Clans"
 gaeautonomy_desc: "The power of the King in matters of national governance, foreign policy, and warfare is unquestioned. It remains true, however, that no man rules alone. By allowing the Chiefs autonomy in the management of their own lands and clans, we can alleviate the burden of local administration from the crown, and ensure that matters relevant on the local level are managed on the local level."
 #Cornwall
 crn_society: "Militarized Society"
 crn_society_desc: "In an attempt to both distance themselves from their Anglo-Saxon oppressors and to create the fighting force that would be necessary to defend against them - not to mention to reclaim the British Isles from the Germanic tyrants eventually - the rulers of Cornwall have looked to the period of Roman rule of Britain for inspiration. Civil administration will be mixed with military command, and the magistrates of Cornish towns and villages will be expected to serve as militia commanders simultaneously. To ensure the defence and survival of the Cornish state, every community within the realm must be ready to muster arms and men at a moment’s notice, for none can know when the perfidious Angles will attack."
 crn_tinbaron: "Tin Barons"
 crn_tinbaron_desc: "Though deprived of the military leadership that most nobles across Europe enjoy, Cornish aristocrats have not found themselves entirely without influence and power. Many valuable tin deposits exist on land owned by Cornish nobles, granting them great wealth and prestige. Rather than being entrusted with control over the military, the aristocrats of Cornwall have increasingly relied upon for matters of industry, instead."
 crn_divide: "Divide et Impera"
 crn_divide_desc: "As Cornwall prepares to expand her borders, it once more looks to Rome as an example of how to handle newly conquered territories. For example, Cornwall would never be able to control the entirety of the island of Great Britain if it maintained the existing, massive polities of England and Scotland - they are simply too large for the much smaller Cornwall ever to hope to rein them in as-is. However, if Cornwall were to formally break England up into the Heptarchy or to break Scotland into local clans, these smaller entities would be much easier to govern. Such an example must be used no matter where Cornwall stakes its claim, lest the great territories she seeks to conquer overwhelm her ability to manage them."
 crn_foreign: "Foreign Bureaucrats"
 crn_foreign_desc: "There is too much land and not enough Cornishmen to administer all of it. The Brythonic people have been reduced in number over the centuries. The result is that the Cornish people are increasingly a minority among the population that Cornwall claims sovereignty over. No other choice is available. Cornwall must adapt its bureaucracy to allow its non-Cornish subjects to take civil and military positions, albeit under the watchful eye of their Cornish superiors. Maybe - if they learn the Cornish language and Cornish customs - they might even be allowed to be counted among proper Cornishmen?"
 crn_nothing: "Nothing Outside the Country"
 crn_nothing_desc: "There is no sovereign, nor are there commoners. There is no noble, nor are there peasants. There is no priest, nor are there merchants. There is only Cornwall and the citizens that serve her."
 crn_general: "The General Staff"
 crn_general_desc: "The Cornish sovereign exists for one reason, and for one reason only: to lead the Cornish military to victory and glory. Everything else is secondary. While God has divinely appointed the Cornish sovereign to fulfil that duty… Sometimes, the heavenly roll of the dice turns up a little bit short. The leading generals of the Cornish army will be granted the power to take control from the sovereign or overrule his decisions, depending upon the circumstances. No matter how much holy grace he has been blessed with, one man should be allowed to sink the Cornish ship of state all on his own."
 #Lotharingia
 lotfmelish: "Professionalise Flemish Pikemen"
 lotfmelish_desc: "The Flemish pike militias of the low countries have proven their use as an effective fighting force, particularly against the landed nobility. By modernizing and professionalizing them we can create a new loyal and strong pike army free of noble intervention."
 lotreform: "Reform the Missus Dominicus"
 lotreform_desc: "The Missus Dominicus is an old Carolingian official who is centrally appointed to supervise the administration and judicial goings-on of a province. Given our precarious geopolitical situation, we need to retain more control over the old noble magnates. By reestablishing the old office, we can hope to reduce corruption and increase our revenues."
 lotdutch: "Dutch Regiments"
 lotdutch_desc: "With our wealth limitless and our enemies encircling us, we must always evolve and adapt to defend our realm. The Dutch to our north have developed highly effective firing tactics and organization. By integrating these Dutch regiments into our army, we can continue to adapt and keep up with our rivals."
 lotculture: "Lotharingian Court Culture"
 lotculture_desc: "Situated on the crossroads of many cultures and empires, a unique culture amongst our elite has evolved. They speak an amalgamation of Dutch, Flemish, French, German, and English while being uniquely Lotharingian. By promoting this new culture we can not only strengthen our cohesion, but also communicate better with our neighbors."
 lotprinces: "The Merchant Princes"
 lotprinces_desc: "With staggering amount of wealth flowing into the low countries from the New World and Asia a new wealthy class has emerged.
