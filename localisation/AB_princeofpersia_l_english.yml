 jlr_first: "Legacy of the Great Khan"
 jlr_first_desc: "When Genghis Khan embarked to conquer Persia, he entrusted the Western campaigns to Ilge Noyan Jalayir. The spearpoint in the Mongol Vanguard, we advanced all the way to Syria, all the while the Great Khan's heirs still fought for control of Persia. We must remember it was us who conquered Baghdad under the Mongol Banner, and we will honour the legacy of conquest imparted to us."
 jlr_second: "Between Two Rivers, Between Two Worlds"
 jlr_second_desc: "Mesopotamia straddles the divide between East and West, and as the crossroads of Asia we have all sorts of people within our nation. Between the Tigris and Euphrates a diverse society flourishes, and beyond the waters our connections with both Iran and the greater house of Islam are undeniable."
 jlr_third: "Mesopotamian Trade"
 jlr_third_desc: "From the terminus of the Indian Ocean sea trade, we can corner nearly the entire spice trade from our seat in Baghdad. In addition to becoming stupendously wealthy, we can further our expansionist interests off the influx of wealth from the Persian Gulf. If the Turks, Greeks, or Egyptians want spices and other valuable goods, they will be forced to trade with us."
 jlr2_third: "Mesopotamian Trade"
 jlr2_third_desc: "From the terminus of the Indian Ocean sea trade, we can corner nearly the entire spice trade from our seat in Baghdad. In addition to becoming stupendously wealthy, we can further our expansionist interests off the influx of wealth from the Persian Gulf. If the Turks, Greeks, or Egyptians want spices and other valuable goods, they will be forced to trade with us."
 jlr_fourth: "Stewards of the House of Wisdom"
 jlr_fourth_desc: "With the Mongol conquests in the Mashriq, Baghdad was unfortunately sacked and the once-great House of Wisdom rendered vacant. However, with our overthrow of the tyrannical Il-Khans, we are now the stewards of the centre of innovation in the entire Islamic world. The restoration of the House of Wisdom will undoubtedly be a grand undertaking, but we shall succeed in recreating the glory of Abbasid rule."
 jlr_fifth: "Expanding Dar-Al Islam"
 jlr_fifth_desc: "The House of Islam has long been stagnant, with the oppressive Nizzarids just the latest in a line of dissappointments. With the initial failures to capture Constantinople, cross the Zagros, and unify Iberia, the Islamic world has turned inwards, producing much in terms of cultural and scientific achievements, but little outside. We shall be the great conquerors to reverse the idle apathy of the Muslim world, uniting it under our anointed sovereignity and expanding the House of Islam for the first time in centuries."
 jlr_sixth: "Horse Archery Traditions"
 jlr_sixth_desc: "We have not forgotten our ancestral home on the steppes, nor our traditional practices. The Jalayirid army has long relied on horse archers to ambush and harass enemy forces, but till now they have only consisted of a small part of our forces. Instead of marginalising and replacing our cavalry as other states have done, we shall lean into our past. The Mongol shock tactics served them well, and they will serve us even better."
 jlr_seventh: "Custodianship of Baghdad"
 jlr_seventh_desc: "Baghdad was long the stronghold of the Abbasid Caliphate, but the treacherous Ilkhanate ruined the Caliphate along with the city itself. With the Abbasid Caliphs reduced to Nizzarid puppets and Baghdad's prosperity ruined, the city was ignored until we took up governance. Now, as the former and soon-to-be centre of the Islamic world, we inherit the legacy of Abbasid custodianship, along with a claim to hegemony over the entire Islamic world."

# Reforms #
 persomongol_sultanate: "Perso-Mongol Sultanate"
 persomongol_sultanate_desc: "Born from the breakup of the Ilkhanate, the Jalayirid state’s government is fundamentally similar and fundamentally different from its predecessor's. Whilst keeping the trappings of a Perso-Mongol administration, our state has also integrated various Islamic governmental practices."
 mechanic_negate_unaccepted_iranian_culture_yes: "Provinces in the §YIranian§! culture group will have §Runaccepted§! culture modifier §Gnegated§!."
 jlr_persian_trappings: "Persian Administration"
 jlr_persian_trappings_desc: ""
 jlrmongolcaste: "Mongol Noble Caste"
 jlrmongolcaste_desc: "Those descended from the Mongol clans that settled in Persia and the Levant after the Mongol Invasions make up the majority of our nobility, with most still speaking their traditional language alongside Persian. These Mongol nobles form a substantial backbone of our military administration, maintaining many of the traditions brought with them from the steppe."
 jlrpersianateadmin: "Persianate Administration"
 jlrpersianateadmin_desc: "By adopting the administrative systems of the Persians, we have established a slick, modern bureaucracy ready to face any challenges that our subjects might throw at it, making the integration of new territories easier and the administration of our current holdings much smoother."
 jlrgunpowder: "Gunpowder Empire"
 jlrgunpowder_desc: "With the advent of firearms, the previous traditions of horse archery have slowly become obsolete. To adapt to a changing world, we must rigorously train our soldiery in the proper use of the arquebus and cannon to ensure that we can spread our just rule across all lands."
 jlrnobility: "Perso-Arabic Nobility"
 jlrnobility_desc: "While our noble caste is made up mostly of Mongols, the bureaucrats that do most of the actual administration are largely made up of Persians and Arabs. By lifting any restrictions on both groups rising into the nobility, we can ensure their continued loyalty."

# Events #
 ab_jalayirid.1.t: "The Fate of the Caliph"
 ab_jalayirid.1.d: "At the beginning of their reign over Egypt, the Nizzarids made the bold choice of putting the Abbasid caliph under their tutelage and removing all his political power. Far from weakening their legitimacy, this allowed them to reinforce their control over the mass of the faithful and more firmly establish their dominion. We could continue their practices for our own benefit or we could behave as pious Muslims and honour the Caliph as our legitimate ruler."
 ab_jalayirid.1.a: "Keep the Caliph as a puppet"
 ab_jalayirid.1.b: "The Caliph may unite the Ummah once again"
 ab_jalayirid.3.t: "The Triumph of the Crescent" #Conquest of Persia
 ab_jalayirid.3.d: "As the dust settles, thousands of heathens lay dead and fire temples make way for mosques one thing has become abundantly clear, the star and crescent have triumphed over the Faravahar. Persians across the empire have adopted Islam en masse and can be seen performing the Salah. Zoroastrian has been relegated to the past like the Iranian empires that worshipped it."
 ab_jalayirid.3.a: "Bismillah!"
 ab_jalayirid.4.t: "The Paradise Gardens of Baghdad" #Baghdad the most developed Islamic province
 ab_jalayirid.4.d: "When Baghdad was built the centre of the city was reserved for luscious gardens surrounding the palace of the Caliph. While the city has since outgrown its concentric walls and the city has changed hands multiple times in history, the Islamic love for greenery hasn't faded. Baghdad has grown to become the crown jewel of the Ummah once more and it is only fitting that we plant new gardens to eclipse both the old greenery of Baghdad and even the hanging gardens of Babylon itself."
 ab_jalayirid.4.a: "This will make lesser Sultans turn green with Envy!"
 ab_jalayirid.5.t: "The Second Islamic Golden Age"
 ab_jalayirid.5.d: "The Islamic Golden Age marked a high point in art, literature, culture, and the sciences for not only the Ummah but humanity as a whole. Being kick-started under the esteemed Harun Al-Rashid, subsequent Abbasid Caliphs patronised scholars of all creeds and ethnicities, but it was not to last. The Mongol siege of Baghdad in 1258 brought an abrupt end to the golden age with Baghdad reduced to a shell of itself with the house of wisdom being all but destroyed. With the reconstruction of the city and renewed patronage of scholars brought in from as far as Khorasan and Iberia, Baghdad has slowly re-emerged as a centre of learning that learned men are all too eager to visit. Rising from the ashes of the Mongol invasions a second golden age for the Ummah looms on the Horizon!"
 ab_jalayirid.5.a: "A new dawn has broken in the Islamic world!"
 ab_jalayirid.6.t: "The Mongol Traditions"
 ab_jalayirid.6.d: "Despite having restored the Abbasids to their rightful and legitimate rule, much of our nobility and army is still composed of Mongol-descended people. The traditions and the legacy of our ancestors will be treated with respect even in the newly restored Abbasid Caliphate."
 ab_jalayirid.6.a: "Mongol blood still ruins in our veins!"

 jlr_rival_sultanates_title: "Rival the Sultanates"
 jlr_rival_sultanates_desc: "The Middle East has many forces on its chessboard, the largest armies in the region belong to our enemies, the Nizzarids and the Seljuks. To protect our territories and the real Caliph we must create an army capable of fighting for our faith."
 jlr_ilkhanate_title: "Reunite with the Ilkhanate"
 jlr_ilkhanate_desc: "The Ilkhanate was formerly the ruling power of Persia but its collapse offered us and many other dominions a chance to break free.

 jlr_caucasia_title: "Safeguard Caucasia"

 jlr_cyprus_desc: "The island of Cyprus has been a key hub in Mediterranean trade since ancient times, but is now a base for Crusader dominance in the region.

 jlr_nizzarids_title: "Dethrone the Nizzarids"
 jlr_nizzarids_desc: "We have reached the final battle against the greatest enemy that has stood in our way, we are at the gates of Egypt ready to challenge all the might of the Nizzardis.

 jlr_cage_title: "Break the Gilded Cage"

 jlr_mecca_desc: "As representatives of the Abbasid Caliph's power and protectors of the Islamic faith it is our duty and right to protect the sacred cities Makka al-mukarrama and al-Madinah al-munawwara by claiming the title of Sharifate of Hejaz, granting us greater authority in the eyes of the faithful and bringing the 'Ummah to ever greater unity."
 jlr_zagros_title: "The Zagros Frontier"
 jlr_zagros_desc: "The Zagros Mountains represent the real border between Persia and the Mashriq lands.

 jlr_coastline_title: "Advance Along the Coastline"

 jlr_africa_desc: "Even before the Romans, North Africa found its major development centers in Egypt and Ifriqiya.

 jlr_khorasan_title: "Pacify Khorasan"
 jlr_khorasan_desc: "Khorasan is a symbolic land dear to the Abbasid dynasty, in fact their lineage arose from these lands, driving out the inept Umayyads from the Caliph's throne.

 jlr_sicily_title: "Italian Intervention"
 jlr_sicily_desc: "Beyond the Mediterranean Sea lies a threat not only political but also religious.

 jlr_nahrawan_title: "The Nahrawan Canal"
 jlr_nahrawan_desc: "Having taken on the task of restoring Baghdad's glory to its former glory, it will be crucial to re-establish the Nahrawan Canal system.

 jlr_industrialize_title: "Industrialise the Sultanate"
 jlr_industrialize_desc: "The sultanate is facing new and ever greater challenges, we must try to keep up with technological innovations otherwise we will fall behind the European powers.

 jlr_merchant_title: "Construct a Merchant Fleet"
 jlr_merchant_desc: "Our main access to trade with the Indies is represented by the Persian Gulf, through the city of Basra. The merchants of the city therefore required the protection of the Sultan on the seas."
 jlr_hormuz_title: "Seize Hormuz"
 jlr_hormuz_desc: "The island of Hormuz is located at the end of the Persian Gulf and its control would allow us an easy connection with the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean, guaranteeing us the dominance of the Arab and Persian maritime trade in the area."
 jlr_gulf_title: "Gulf Trade Monopoly"
 jlr_gulf_desc: "Our merchant fleets have secured great influence in the region but some forces still oppose our monopoly of the region. Allah has granted us the seas and it is our duty to reclaim them."
 jlr_bahrain_title: "Control the Coastline"
 jlr_bahrain_desc: "To the south of our domains lie the diverse and divided emirates and sultanates of eastern Arabia. Gaining control of this coastline will be important in asserting our power over the seas and boosting trade in the region. Their weakness will be our strength."

 msn_third_desc: "The ancient and lucrative trade of the Persian call to us. It is time that we develop a navy capable of exerting our dominance throughout the whole gulf."
 msn_fourth: "Crossroads of Faith"
 msn_fourth_desc: "A Christian oligarchy ruling over Zoroastrians and Muslims, surrounded by heathen realms does not survive by being zealous. We have maintained our power through tolerance and understanding."
 msn_fifth: "Aramaic Intelligentsia"
 msn_fifth_desc: "We are one of the last surviving places that still uses the old tongue of Aramaic. Once the lingua franca of the levant, it has all but died out now. By supporting Aramaic scholars and artists we can continue our proud use of this ancient language, leading to a unique and cultured local elite."
 msn_sixth: "Upon Alexandria, Antiochia and Charax"
 msn_sixth_desc: "Our current capital is built on the foundation of many old and great cities such as Alexandria on the Characene, Antiochia on Characene, and Charax. We must continue this legacy of city building, and strive to make our current cities as great as those that came before them."
 msn_seventh: "Seeking New Waters" 
 msn_seventh_desc: "While the Gulf provides us with a rich stream of income, we should not forget where this wealth comes from. Perhaps if we followed the trade ships to their source we could get even better deals from the merchants?"
 msn2_seventh: "Seeking New Waters" 
 msn2_seventh_desc: "While the Gulf provides us with a rich stream of income, we should not forget where this wealth comes from. Perhaps if we followed the trade ships to their source we could get even better deals from the merchants?"

 ab_maysan.1.t: "Claims on Indian Trade Ports"
 ab_maysan.1.d: "After decades spent striking deals with the merchants of India, our trade captains bore of the haggling and mind-games it takes just to dock their ships, let alone turn a profit. It is time we establish a more... permanent presence in the Indian subcontinent."
 ab_maysan.1.a: "The riches of India shall be ours!"
 ab_maysan.2.t: "Into India"
 ab_maysan.2.d: "While our neighbors squabble over their petty territorial claims in Iran, we are expanding our influence over the Indian subcontinent through shrewd diplomacy and the occasional military expedition. With our influence in India expanding, downstream trade continues to flow towards Basra and bypass our neighbors."
 ab_maysan.2.a: "I wonder when they'll take notice..."
 ab_maysan.3.t: "The Question of Tolerance"
 ab_maysan.3.d: "Because our state is constructed upon profit-seeking rather than ideology, we've attracted all kinds of people to our merchant fleets. The clergy of Basra are not excatly keen on there being Hindus, Muslims, and Zoroastrians among our ranks, and we must make a decision regarding their status under our jurisdiction."
 ab_maysan.3.a: "Let them practice in peace"
 ab_maysan.3.b: "They shall know that Christ is King"

 ab_msn_engaging_diplomats_desc: "In order to secure our trade routes and survive in such a tumultuous area as this, it is imperative we secure allies in the region, be it on equal terms or... via hostile takeover."
 ab_msn_persian_ambitions_title: "Ambitions in Persia"
 ab_msn_persian_ambitions_desc: "The riches of Persia are far too lucrative to pass up, we could get a business partner in the region to sell silks and other valuables to us as a discount or we could take control of these valuable trade routes ourselves."
 ab_msn_caspian_riches_title: "Riches of the Caspian"
 ab_msn_caspian_riches_desc: "The Caspian sea like any body of water promotes trade by offering a safer alternative to the rather dangerous land routes running through a subcontinent embroiled in near constant warfare. by securing ports on the Caspian coastline we ensure we get our fair share."
 ab_msn_hegemony_on_trade_title: "Hegemony on Trade"
 ab_msn_hegemony_on_trade_desc: "Through force or via buyout, it doesn't matter as long as the competition is rendered uncompetitive. By acquiring a majority share of the trade flowing into Persia we effectively render all of our rivals obsolete as they won't be able to fund an army large enough to oppose us!"
 ab_msn_service_for_masses_title: "Services for the Masses"
 ab_msn_service_for_masses_desc: "By building houses of worship we can strengthen communal ties and further reinforce our faith... With the added benefits of securing donations from our most valued patrons."

 ab_msn_regional_monopolies_desc: "Bahrain is an excellent location to set up shop, easily defendable and the perfect waystation to resupply our troops and merchants. By securing the island we further our interests in the region and increase our stranglehold over Arabian trade."
 ab_msn_masters_of_persia_title: "Masters of Persia"
 ab_msn_masters_of_persia_desc: "Persia has long been an important leg of the silk road trade route. By monopolising trade flowing in and out of the region we can charge huge markups on silks and spices coming from the east, sometimes it pays off to be the middleman!"
 ab_msn_armed_nation_title: "An Armed Nation"
 ab_msn_armed_nation_desc: "`Diplomacy isn't always enough to sway opinions, we have multiple larger neighbours hungrily eyeing up our lands but we won't cave that easily. By building up our forces we ensure our neighbours think twice before trying any funny business."

 ab_msn_into_basra_desc: "Basra, the pearl of the Persian gulf! Easily the second largest city in Al-Iraq after the Muslim stronghold of Baghdad, valuable goods from all over the Indian Ocean flow into its ports.

 ab_msn_presence_in_hormuz_title: "Presence in Hormuz"
 ab_msn_presence_in_hormuz_desc: "The Persian coast is ripe for the taking. The land itself offers little value being mostly mountainous and dry but is vital in our plans of locking the Gulf down in the long run."
 ab_msn_hormuzi_dominance_title: "Hormuzi Dominance"
 ab_msn_hormuzi_dominance_desc: "The Isle of Hormuz is a vital entrepot in the gulf and sits in the narrow strait opening between the Arabian mainland and Iran. Were we to gain control over it all trade flowing into the gulf would have to be conducted on Maysani terms ensuring maximum profit!"
 ab_msn_into_india_title: "Into India"
 ab_msn_into_india_desc: "Western India is home to some of the most spectacular trading cities in the Indian ocean. Khambhat, famous for its silk and Textiles and Surat, an emporium where everything from gold to diamonds along with a slew of goods from southern India flow through its harbour. We must take control of these ports at any cost!"

 ab_msn_humanist_mission_2_title: "Diversity of Faith"
 ab_msn_humanist_mission_2_desc: "A population as diverse as ours doesn't lend itself well to zealotry, only a fool would try to upset our peaceful coexistence in the name of religion or other moral hogwash. We live side by side regardless of religion or creed, it doesn't matter if you're Syriac, Sunni, Shia or Zoroastrian, all are welcome."
 ab_msn_humanist_mission_3_title: "Thriving Minorities"
 ab_msn_humanist_mission_3_desc: "Our republic is filled with people of all creeds, faiths and ethnicities, people from all of the Indian ocean come to barter and trade in our ports and we have only grown richer from it, both monetarily and culturally. As long as Maysan continues to thrive, so will the minorities within our borders."
 ab_msn_zealous_mission_1_title: "Religious Cohesion"
 ab_msn_zealous_mission_1_desc: "The time for interfaith dialogue has come to an end! It has become clear that in order to hold the republic together we must enforce the state religion by any means possible, be it through forced conversions or expelling those who refuse to do so."
 ab_msn_zealous_mission_2_title: "A Faithful Population"
 ab_msn_zealous_mission_2_desc: "Our people are slowly coming around to [Root.Religion.GetName], places of worship are packed and a greater emphasis on our religion is put on the daily goings on of life, other religions are slowly being phased out as time goes on."

 msn_cities_title: "Expand the Trading Cities"
 msn_cities_desc: "Iran and the surrounding areas are home to many centres of trade like Shiraz, Basra, Baghdad and Shapurshahr. In order to facilitate this we need to build grand bazaars and storage houses to accommodate traders, merchants and their wares."

 msn_colonial_desc: "The Indian Ocean is vast and exploiting it could bring us vast riches, let us set up a colonial office to expand our reach beyond the Gulf of Persia into India and Africa."
 msn_east_africa_title: "East African Bases"
 msn_east_africa_desc: "Arab traders have imported Ivory, gold and Zanj slaves from the Swahili coast for centuries,the sultanates Kilwa and Ajuraan are a constant thorn in our side in our pursuit of monopolising the Indian Ocean trade. However if we were to directly own the coast ourselves we would have easier access to these valuable commodities."
 msn_cape_title: "Reach the Cape"
 msn_cape_desc: "The Atlantic and Indian Oceans meet at the Cape of Africa, clashing Ocean currents make these waters treacherous and hard to navigate. Having an outpost or two around these parts might make it easier to conduct expeditions to Western Africa and beyond."

 msn_indian_ports_title: "Seize Indian Ports"
 msn_indian_ports_desc: "Gujarat isn't the only hotbed of commerce on the Indian subcontinent, to the south lie Kochin and Calicut and further afield the fabulously wealthy Bengal delta. The more ports fall under our sovereignty the tighter our grip on the subcontinent will be."
 msn_spice_title: "The Spice Must Flow"
 msn_spice_desc: "While India is home to spices like pepper, cinnamon and tumeric, the more exotic spices come from the Malay archipelago.

 msn_down_under_title: "The Land Down Under"
 msn_down_under_desc: "Merchants from Java tell of a giant landmass encountered by fishermen blown off course.

 msn_coromandel_title: "Dominate Coromandel"
 msn_coromandel_desc: "Coromandel, the centre of the Indian Ocean. By seizing control of its ports and trade routes we have effectively become the terminus of the entire Indian Ocean trade.

# Ideas #
 NNV_ideas: "Ninevite Ideas"
 NNV_ideas_start: "Ninevite Traditions"
 NNV_ideas_bonus: "Ninevite Ambition"
 nnv_first: "Restore the Nestorian Patriarch"
 nnv_first_desc: "Ever since the Arab conquest of Mesopotamia, there has been no proper head of our church, and our faith’s legitimacy has suffered as a result. We must once and for all put a stop to this by appointing the Bishop of Chaldea as the head of our Church and all Nestorians, restoring our subjects’ confidence in our church as an institution."
 nnv_second: "The Light in a Sea of Darkness"
 nnv_second_desc: "For countless centuries, our Church has been like a candle left outside on a cold winter night, constantly under threat of blowing out, particularly when we were under Arab rule. Now that we have secured our independence with the collapse of the Ayyubids, however, we must do everything in our power to stay independent, lest the flame of Christendom be extinguished in the Middle East for good."
 nnv_third: "Petty Kings of Assyria"
 nnv_third_desc: "To the Arabs that surround us, we are the Emirate of Mosul, despite neither being Muslim nor basing our administration in city of Mosul proper. To our Christian brothers in the west, however, we have been called the 'Kingdom of Assyria' despite only holding enough land to realistically be classed as a duchy. Perhaps with our current holdings we can never hope to be a proper kingdom, but we can use their titles to further legitimize our rule over what we have."
 nnv_fourth: "Contact the Faithful"
 nnv_fourth_desc: "Thanks to the so-called 'Crusades' that weakened the large Islamic states all around us, we know of a land where Chrisitians worship free of persecution and rule their own, large kingdoms. These “crusaders” are gone now, but thanks to them we know where to look to find other, stronger, allies in the faith."
 nnv_fifth: "Purchase Arms from the West"
 nnv_fifth_desc: "Now that we have established contact with these large states, we have heard alarming news: our military is woefully out of date! To remedy this, we must hire officers and secure arms contracts from the Europeans, so as to give us the edge we need when going up against much larger heathen forces."
 nnv_sixth: "Compete With New World Goods"
 nnv_sixth_desc: "We have learned from our contacts in Europe that there is apparently a 'New World' filled with exotic goods and ideal places to grow them. We may be able to entirely outcompete this new market, but we may be able to offer better deals to Bulgar and Polish merchants then they could otherwise get in things like sugar, fruits, and other goods that are seen as exotic in Europe." 
 nnv_seventh: "A Homeland for All Assyrians"
 nnv_seventh_desc: "As other Christians in the Levant, Mesopotamia, and even further afield see that our state  has endured the test of them, have learned men from among them have begun to flock to our court in an effort to prove their worth to us. They are all too eager to work for us rather than their previous Islamic masters, and as much they are much less picky about how much we pay them."

 ASR2_ideas_bonus: "Assyrian Ambition"
 asr_first: "Assyrian Patriarchate"
 asr_first_desc: "After much struggle, we have finally established the Assyria Patriarchate as the head of the church of the east. With this ecclesiastical dominance we can further use this to control the religion of our realm."
 asr_second: "Legacy of Brutality"
 asr_second_desc: "'I swiftly marched to Babylon which I was intent upon conquering. I blew like the onrush of a hurricane and enveloped the city like a fog. I completely surrounded it and captured it by breaching and scaling the walls. I did not spare his mighty warriors, young or old, but filled the city square with their corpses... The city and houses I completely destroyed from foundations to roof and set fire to them. I tore down both inner and outer city walls, temples, temple-towers made of brick and clay - as many as there were - and threw everything into the Arahtu canal. I dug a ditch inside the city and thereby levelled off the earth on its site with water. I destroyed even the outline of its foundations. I flattened it more than any flood could have done. In order that the site of that city and its temples would never be remembered, I devastated it with water so that it became a mere meadow.'' - Sennacherib, King of Assyria"
 asr_third: "Christianization of the East"
 asr_third_desc: "Long has the east suffered under the rule of the non believers, and the dominance of the Christians has long been superceded by Islam and the Fire worshipers. With our power restored we can set to rectify this current situation, soon all of the east will once again follow the Cross."
 asr_fourth: "The First Empire"
 asr_fourth_desc: "In our ancient songs and legends, we remember our great empire. When the land was young we smashed the realms and burned the cities of our rivals, forging the first true empire of the world, let us not forget our history."
 asr_fifth: "Bedouin Auxiliaries"
 asr_fifth_desc: "The Arabs to our south are expert survivors, perfectly at home in the harsh desert, and fearsome warriors. We should seek to incorporate these people into our army, in order to better wage war in the unforgiving land of our home."
 asr_sixth: "Restore the Ancient Cities"
 asr_sixth_desc: "The great cities such as Assur, Nineveh, Kalhu, Hatra, and Adiabene have fallen into decay. With our new found power we must look towards the repopulation and rebuilding of these once great centres of power."
 asr_seventh: "Legacy of the Conquerors"
 asr_seventh_desc: "Since the days of the Israelites, our great kings have been known as some of the greatest and most fearsome conquerors to ever rule in the Levant. We must always remember their legacy and seek to break more realms upon the iron boot of Assyria."

# Reforms #
 syriacmonarchy: "Syriac Monarchy"
 syriacmonarchy_desc: "Modelled after the ancient Assyrian empires of old, the Syriac monarchy is focused on a strict caste system and the expectation of homage to the Malka, giving the monarch free reign to assign levied peasants to different provinces when their labour is required and giving them a revered status."
 nnvsukkallu: "The Office of Sukkallu"
 nnvsukkallu_desc: "The office of Sukkallu is one that is elected by the most influential of the Assyrian nobility, acting as a grand vizier and staunch advisor to the Malka. This ensures the nobility is represented in the affairs of government. The role is also frequently filled by the heir apparent, leading to a far easier transfer of power between monarchs."
 nnvprovincial: "Provincial System"
 nnvprovincial_desc: "We have adopted a strictly organized provincial system not dissimilar to that of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the time of our culture’s zenith. There are many lessons to be learned from both the successes and failures of this system, allowing us to have a flexible amount of autonomy in our conquered territories."
 nnvilku: "Ilku System"
 nnvilku_desc: "The Ilku System allows us to grant arable land to our subjects in exchange for military service, allowing us the ability to levy vast numbers of suitable recruits and cheaply garrison the forts across our state."

 ab_nineveh.1.t: "Timed Mission Unlocked"
 ab_nineveh.1.d: "We have unlocked 'Reunite Our Brethen' timed mission! If we complete this mission before the year 1455, we will unlock a strong permanent bonus. Should we fail, the mission will be §Rpermanently removed§! from our mission tree."
 ab_nineveh.1.a: "Understood"
 ab_nineveh.2.t: "Timed Mission Failed"
 ab_nineveh.2.d: "We have failed to complete 'Reunite Our Brethren' mission before the year 1455, therefore the mission will be permanently removed from our mission tree."
 ab_nineveh.2.a: "Unfortunate"
 ab_nineveh.3.t: "Assyria Reborn"
 ab_nineveh.3.d: "That of the Syriac people, descendants of those ancient Assyrians who, at one point, had control over all of the East, has been seen as just another diaspora by the powers that be for too long. Our state, now united under the Nestorian faith, has suffered and made sacrifices to make the Assyrian diaspora no longer, but now we shall stand united against all odds." 
 ab_nineveh.3.a: "This is the beginning of a new era." 
 ab_nineveh.4.t: "Restoration of the Maphrian"
 ab_nineveh.4.d: "The Grand Metropolitan of the East and the lands to which it belongs have been restored in their entirety under our supervision, unifying large swathes of territory who'd long abandoned all hope for our return. Their fate is once again in our hands, and we shall hold true to our oath of protecting all of our subjects, new and old." 
 ab_nineveh.4.a: "Blessed be God!" 
 ab_nineveh.5.t: "A New Empire"
 ab_nineveh.5.d: "The hated Persians, our historical enemies, those responsible for disbanding our state, have taken blow after blow before crumbling under our might. The East has been secured by our troops and, even though our enemies continue to deny it, there is no doubt that we have come far and that we are here to stay. The Nestorian Patriarch, a figure who was once a mere puppet, a prisoner in the hands of stronger nations, is now free to look at his people with pride. And our moderate monarch, the invisible hand holding the state together, smiles upon the green fields and fertile territories that he has brought unto the Assyrian people. Gone are the petty Persianates, and the Arabs are no longer a threat - for we have taken that place." 
 ab_nineveh.5.a: "May the world tremble!"

# Missions #
 nnv_timed1_title: "Timed Mission"
 nnv_timed1_desc: "This mission can be unlocked by completing '§YSecure Nineveh§!' mission before the year §Y1455§!."
 NNV_UNLOCKABLE: "This mission can be unlocked by completing '§YSecure Nineveh§!' mission before the year §Y1455§!."
 nnv_secure_nineveh_title: "Secure Nineveh"
 nnv_secure_nineveh_desc: "Our position is precarious. On all sides we are surrounded by warmongers who seek to establish empires for themselves. We must secure ourselves, either by mustering a sufficient army or investing in a beneficial alliance."
 nnv_brethren_title: "Reunite Our Brethren"
 nnv_brethren_desc: "Our recent efforts to bolster our state's ability to project itself have paid off - more than we expected. Assyrians both within and beyond our borders are clamouring for change, clamouring for a state of our own, where a new, fruitful future may be forged and lost lands regained. The fire of this newfound hope must not be extinguished - make haste!"
 nnv_expand_state_title: "Expand the State"
 nnv_expand_state_desc: "We would be fools to not exploit the turmoil engulfing the world around us. If we continue to stagnate as a petty enclave, our neighbours will conquer us without hesitation. We must announce to the world that we are a power like any other - not a people relegated to the past!"
 nnv_anatolian_title: "Anatolian Incursion"
 nnv_anatolian_desc: "With our holdings established and armies emboldened, we must look beyond our homelands. Anatolia boasts riches - fertile valleys, luscious rivers and trustworthy trade routes. We must carve out a piece of this region for ourselves!"
 nnv_turks_title: "Overpower the Turks"
 nnv_turks_desc: "For a time now, the Turks have been the dominant force in Eastern Anatolia. The Romans have come and gone and the Arabs have tried and failed to reign over Anatolia in any meaningful sense. This has left Anatolia in the hands of these steppe wanderers - who, if left unchecked, could unite the region and become a power proper. We must chasten them for their arrogance."
 nnv_integrate_title: "Integrate Anatolia"
 nnv_integrate_desc: "Anatolia has been a sore region for many centuries now - a place of strife, a place of contention, a place of indecision. Greek Christians, Turkish Muslims, Coptic Armenians... They have waged bloody, terrible warfare over these old mountain passes and in vain. Clearly, it is Nestorian, Assyrian Anatolia that is fated to come. We must bring it about once and for all!"
 nnv_armenia_title: "Liberate Armenia"
 nnv_armenia_desc: "The Armenians share common ground with Assyrians. They follow a lonely faith in a vast heathen world. They have known conquerors, oppression, genocide and adversity. Their land is ancient, ancient beyond that of the rivals of today. They deserve retribution and liberation just as we do - and they shall get it!"
 nnv_ilkhan_title: "Defeat the Ilkhan"
 nnv_ilkhan_desc: "The dreaded Ilkhan and their foolish followers are to us but another foreign marauder band. Over the long history of our people, such invaders have come and gone - reduced to skull and bone by the wrath of warfare. So too shall the Ilkhan fall - this time, at our hands."
 nnv_turnabout_title: "Levantine Turnabout"
 nnv_turnabout_desc: "The Nizzarid scourge bears its teeth at us, hungrily eyeing our holdings. Unbeknownst to them, the one true God is at our side. By Christ's grace, we will strike fear into the hearts of these heathens. Should we turn the tide, their garrisons will lose faith in their wretched overlords and realise Assyrian hegemony is inevitable!"
 nnv_jazira_title: "Control Gazarta"
 nnv_jazira_desc: "Gazarta is a vital northern region encompassing the Euphrates and Tigris. For too long, the Jalayirids have squandered its potential, abusing its populace and natural resources. Furthermore, if it were to return to our fold, it would bring us into direct competition with the dreaded Nizzarids... Gazarta must be ours." 
 nnv_syria_title: "Liberate Syria"
 nnv_syria_desc: "Syria was the heartland of Christianity. Christ walked the Earth amidst Syrian pastures, spreading his good word. His disciples entrenched the humble villages of the region in no time at all following his death - showing how pious, good and pure its populace was at heart... Today, it stands oppressed and abused by the false might of Islam. Tomorrow, by our hand, it will be free once more!" 
 nnv_asoristan_title: "Seize Asoristan"
 nnv_asoristan_desc: "Asoristan, the fertile province fed by the wisened, ancient Euphrates and Tigris rivers, has been the heartland of many an empire, including that of our ancestors. Today, it is but a stepping stone for vile nomad bands - its ancient cities mere playthings, its population seen as cattle to be domesticated. It must return to our fold!"
 nnv_basra_title: "Reach the Gulf"
 nnv_basra_desc: "The gulf province of Basra is an avenue of trade and commerce from faraway. Where the ancient rivers end, the vast sea begins. Whoever controls this province has a gateway to the greater world. It must be ours!"
 nnv_legacy_title: "Legacy of Esarhaddon"
 nnv_legacy_desc: "Many, many centuries ago, the great Esarhaddon brought Egypt under Assyrian rule. This magnificent act made Assyria the largest empire the world had yet seen. To honour his legacy and reclaim our lost honour, the great granary of Egypt must be rendered Assyrian once more!"
 nnv_zagros_title: "The Zagros Frontier"
 nnv_zagros_desc: "In ancient times, our ancestors established borders along the extent of the Zagros. They served as a powerful barrier against the Persians, a natural defence against wanderers near and far. We are advised by our military brass to take a similar precaution and secure this region while Persia is divided."
 nnv_princes_title: "Defeat the Princes"
 nnv_princes_desc: "Persia, over the centuries, has developed into a wise and powerful region. Great empires have originated in its marvellous extent, imposing their rule upon not only all of Persia, but the Levant as a whole. This risk cannot be understated, especially in this time of turbulence. We must kill this threat in the cradle and prevent Persia from rising up ever again."
 nnv_empire_title: "A New Empire"
 nnv_empire_desc: "In the old times, Assyria never quite encroached upon Persia proper. Back then, the mountains of Persia were quiet, humble. Now, the entire region is a fascinating hotbed of competitive commerce, mystical fanaticism and mad aspirations of conquest. It would do well under the fold of another empire - namely, ours! It would be a fine addition to a new, modern, resurgent Assyria - a new empire."
 nnv_step_title: "Step Out of the Shadows"
 nnv_step_desc: "Assyria was once a prospering empire that pioneered both ways to administrate realms and the armies with which to expand it, we are nowhere near that level of glory but improving our economic base will allow us to step out of the shadows."
 nnv_asur_title: "Rebuild Ašur"
 nnv_asur_desc: "Ašur is the city that gives our state it's name, sacked by the Sassanids over a millenia ago, it faded into obscurity. It will take a monumental effort to restore it to it's rightful place, an effort we should gladly put in."
 nnv_fertile_title: "The Fertile Crescent"
 nnv_fertile_desc: "Mesopotamia is the most fertile region of the Middle East, this fertility allowed it to be the Cradle of Civilization in the past and it will now allow us to not only to feed our people with it, but also grow important cash crops such as sugar."
 nnv_church_title: "The Church of the East"
 nnv_church_desc: "The middle east is a region that bolsters a great deal of different faiths, from the crusader states, to coptics to the zoroastrians and the muslims, it can be quite easy for people's minds to wander to the wrong way of worship or worshipping the wrong god. Let us build churches across the realm to ensure our people follow our faith."
 nnv_script_title: "Reform the Syriac Script"
 nnv_script_desc: "The Syriac Script is the precursor of many alphabets used throughout Central Asia, such as the turkish alphabet and Mongolian Scripts, however, unlike those alphabets derived from the Syriac Script, Syriac is outdated and needs a total overhaul. It'll be a difficult task but one our monarch believes our advisors are capable of doing."
 nnv_codify_title: "Codify the Language"
 nnv_codify_desc: "It was with great effort that our advisors managed to reform the Syriac Script and modernise it to a great standard, however, the matter of grammatical structures cannot be solved with an alphabet, the entire language needs to be codified so that it can be perserved."
 nnv_educate_title: "Educate the Nation"
 nnv_educate_desc: "Knowledge is a powerful tool, because we innovated and had knowledge on government and military, Assyria managed to become an empire in the past. Now, we should aim to restore this advantage. Create universities and centers of learning so we may have better and cheaper advisors serve us in the future."
 nnv_nahrawan_title: "The Nahrawan Canal"
 nnv_nahrawan_desc: "The Nahrawan Canal is a great irrigation and navigation canal, stretching as far as the eye can see and even beyond. Expanding this great waterway will allow our nation's agriculture to be improved even further as well as allow the produce the reach the populace quicker."
 nnv_spread_title: "Spread the True Faith"
 nnv_spread_desc: "Through our efforts building churches and sending missionaries to areas of our lands where the populace disagreed with our beliefs, we managed to convert a few people to our faith already, however this is not enough. Our lands cannot be filled with people who disagree with our views on faith."
 nnv_maphrian_title: "Restore the Maphrian"
 nnv_maphrian_desc: "We built churches, we converted heretics and heathens and now Nestorianism is the dominant faith in Mesopotamia, however this poses a problem as our patriarchs aren't always able to handle responsibilities. This doesn't have to be a problem though, in the past Maphrians served as second-in-commands to the patriarchs. Let us restore this role to effectively protect our people."
 nnv_patriarchs_title: "Empower the Patriarchs"
 nnv_patriarchs_desc: "We restored the Maphrians to more effectively handle the religious responsibilities of our nation, however this does not mean our work is done. We should always strive to guarantee that our Patriarchs can enforce their will and in turn they'll make sure the state can share some of the church's donations."
 nnv_jerusalem_title: "Restore Jerusalem"
 nnv_jerusalem_desc: "Jerusalem is the most important City in christianity and Judaism, as well as a holy place for the Muslims, it's importance is unquestionable to all, however, it was been in the hands of muslims for centuries with the only exception being the only marginally better crusader states, however now that it is under our control let us restore this pillar of faith once more."

# Ideas #
 GRG_ideas: "Gurgan Ideas"
 GRG_ideas_start: "Gurgan Traditions"
 GRG_ideas_bonus: "Gurgan Ambition"
 GRG_first: "Rightful Ilkhans"
 GRG_first_desc: "We are the descendants of Togha Temur, the rightful Ilkhan. Following the break up of the Khanate in the 14th Century, Togha would attempt to re-unify the empire from his power base in Gurgan. While his ambitions would be soured with his untimely death at the hands of his rivals, we have not forgotten his dream of a united Mongol Persia."
 GRG_second: "Mongol Legacy"
 GRG_second_desc: "While the other Mongol remnants of Persia have settled down into their decadent city lives, we have not forgotten our roots. Our warriors still hone their skills among the herds of livestock on the open steppe. Our horses are strong and our riders are fierce."
 GRG_third: "The Karakum"
 GRG_third_desc: "Our realm is situated on the great Karakum desert, a truly hostile and desolate barrier against any would be invaders. The black sands sap the strength of both great conqueror and lowly bandit alike."
 GRG_fourth: "Restore Old Gurgan"
 GRG_fourth_desc: "Our powerbase is located in the great city of Gurgan, although it is but a shadow of its former self. Sacked by the Mongols during their conquest of Persia the city has never recovered. We should seek to restore Gurgan to its old glory, as a citadel as defensive as this will make for a fine capital in the our new Ilkhanate."
 GRG_fifth: "Crush the Great Houses"
 GRG_fifth_desc: "A century ago we ruled Persia and ushered in an era of prosperity to the whole region. The old Houses or Persia however, stabbed us in the back and sent us fleeing into the far reaches of our once great empire. We have learned from this mistake, and we now know that keeping the old Houses alive will only lead to more deception. If we are to hold onto Persia again, the Great Houses must be broken!"
 GRG_sixth: "Gateway to the Caspian"
 GRG_sixth_desc: "Our location in the North East of Persia gives us access over the trade caravans travelling from the east to the Caspian sea. Let us look to establish a stronger control over these routes, to better enrich ourselves."
 GRG_seventh: "Control the Turko-Mongol Tribes"
 GRG_seventh_desc: "When the Ilkhanate fell, the tribes loyal to it scurried away to desolate corners of the old empire. Many have made their home in Gurgan, and it is now time for us to put them to use. By puppeting their leaders we can see to it that we use them to enlarge our own army, and re-establish the Ilkhanate over Iran!"

# Events #
 ab_gurgan.1.t: "Timed Mission Unlocked"
 ab_gurgan.1.d: "We have unlocked the 'True Heir of Temur' timed mission. If we complete this mission before the year 1460, we will unlock strong permanent ruler modifier as well as cores on Persia and Khorasan. Should we fail, the mission will be §Rpermanently removed§! from our mission tree."
 ab_gurgan.2.t: "Timed Mission Failed"
 ab_gurgan.2.d: "We have failed to complete the 'True Heir of Temur' timed mission before the year 1460, therefore the mission will be permanently removed from our mission tree."
 ab_gurgan.3.t: "A New Ilkhanate"
 ab_gurgan.3.d: "A new power has risen in Iran, a new Ilkhanate. Not the decadent sluggish pretender khanate that crumbled in the face of equally illegitimate khanates to the north, no, one led by the descendents of Temur Khan. As Iran reels from the brutal and rapid conquest, the Ilkhan turns west, ready for the next campaign to bring Mesopotamia back into the fold."
 ab_gurgan.3.a: "We are ascendant!"

# Missions #
 grg_timed1_title: "Timed Mission"
 grg_timed1_desc: "This mission can be unlocked by completing '§YRein in the Princes§!' mission before the year §Y1460§!."
 grg_princes_title: "Rein in the Princes"
 grg_princes_desc: "With the collapse of the pretender Ilkhanate, Iran is in chaos. Truly the only way to stabilise the region is to reimpose Mongol rule once more. Luckily the true successor to Genghis and Hulagu have bided their time in the North. Let the steppe horse ride across Iran once more!"
 grg_temur_title: "True Heir of Temur"
 grg_temur_desc: "Our first foray into Iran proper has proven to be an outstanding success. We must exploit this victory to sweep through the rest of Iran as fast as possible. Soon the traitors and foolish princes will be broken under our horse, and Temur's legacy will be secured!"
 grg_struggle_title: "Struggle for Mastery"
 grg_struggle_desc: "Secured in our powerbase of Gurgan, let us rebuild our former strength through fire and sword. Once our strength is proven, let us turn our eyes towards the princes and traitors."
 grg_power_title: "New Iranian Power"
 grg_power_desc: "As the dust settles over Persia, the warlords have been forced to accept Temur's heirs as the greatest among them. We must now look towards consolidating our gains and wiping out the last of the independent pretenders to the Ilkhanate."
 grg_ilkhans_title: "End the Unfit Ilkhans"
 grg_ilkhans_desc: "The pretenders must fall. They have let the dreams of Hulagu crumble under their negligence. With the execution of the last traitors, we can finally unify the remaining Mongols in Persia under our banner!"
 grg_bozorg_title: "Iran-e Bozorg"
 grg_bozorg_desc: "We have returned. Our neighbours have crumbled - either falling into our sphere of influence or into the raging waters of history, fading just like a thousand other silly warlords. With our strength insurmountable and our horizons broadening by the day, the total reclamation of Persia is within sight. Onward!"
 grg_consolidate_tribes_title: "Consolidate the Tribes"
 grg_consolidate_tribes_desc: "The distant lands of Turan call to us. Currently the once rich lands of Transoxiana are depopulated and stagnate, crumbling under the ignorance of the squabbling tribes left over from the collapse of the Chagatai Khanate. If we invade and invest in this land, we would have a rich powerbase to stage our reconquest of Persia from."
 grg_silk_cities_title: "The Great Silk Road Cities"
 grg_silk_cities_desc: "We have established control of the ancient trade cities of Central Asia. Many wars have devastated these once great cities, and they are but shadows of their former selves. If we were to restore these cities to their rightful place at the centre of the silk road, the monetary benefits would be immense."
 grg_transoxiana_title: "Securing Transoxiana"
 grg_transoxiana_desc: "We have just scratched the surface of Central Asia with our recent conquests in the region. We must look to fully occupy and integrate it into our own realm. Perhaps then the Turko-Mongol tribes will unite under us and support us in our conquest of the South."
 grg_humiliate_title: "Humiliate the Borjigins"
 grg_humiliate_desc: "While the realms of Batu and Shiban to our north have never seen eye to eye with the Ilkhanate, their lack of help in the collapse of the Ilkhanate and Togha Temur's subsequent attempts to reunify it must not go unpunished! Let us show these so-called Mongols which one of Genghis Khan's successors is the greatest."
 grg_khorasani_title: "Khorasani Incursion"
 grg_khorasani_desc: "The rich lands of Khorasan were also once part of the Ilkhanate, and the realms there are significantly weaker than the great houses of western Iran. By crushing these wayward traitors under the Mongol boot, we will have a strategically important crossroads under our control, allowing us to expand in virtually any direction."
 grg_asoristan_title: "Recover Asoristan"
 grg_asoristan_desc: "While the plight that plagues Asoristan was mostly caused by the destruction wrought by our ancestors, the land itself is still fertile, and most importantly vulnerable. We should look to reclaim Asoristan into Mongol hegemony, but with less sacking and burning, and more investing and integrating."
 grg_ctesiphon_title: "Restore Ctesiphon"
 grg_ctesiphon_desc: "For hundreds of years, Ctesiphon stood as a ceremonious capital of Persia. Known as a place where several cities crowded, met and eventually merged, Ctesiphon was a vital geopolitical crossroad and some say one of the largest cities in the world. After the Muslim conquest however, the city fell into disarray. With vengeance on the menu, our advisors suggest we make from its ruins a city far greater, far more magnificent, far more wealthy than any seen before - a new Ctesiphon, a shining Ctesiphon!"
 grg_nahrawan_title: "Improve the Nahrawan"
 grg_nahrawan_desc: "During the times of Parthia, great works were undertaken along the Tigris and Euphrates to ensure water flowed where it was needed. Mesopotamia was fed by its convoluted, sprawling system of veins - farmers and peasants alike depending on the flow of its waters for sustenance and prosperity. Barbaric infighting and countless wars have seen the canals abused and razed however. Now that we are back in charge, it is our divine duty to see these great works restored and Mesopotamia prosper."
 grg_persianization_title: "Cultural Persianization"
 grg_persianization_desc: "With our reconquest of Persia secured, we must find ways to integrate ourselves more thoroughly with the region. The major factor in the collapse of the old Ilkhanate was its representation as foreign oppressors to the Persian people. This will no longer be the case we have ruled Persia long enough, from now on, this realm is Persia, and it will be ruled by Persian kings."
 grg_embrace_title: "Embrace Zoroastrianism"
 grg_embrace_desc: "Tengri, lord of the blue sky, forgive us, but it is time to say goodbye. The old ways have run their course and the men of our court have turned the minds of people to a new faith. Ahura Mazda will guide us to victory."
 grg_indian_frontier_title: "Indian Frontier"
 grg_indian_frontier_desc: "The fractured and extremely fertile lands of India are ripe for the taking. Let us undo the failures of past Mongols and create truly legendary empire by invading the this wealthy and mysterious land."
 grg_cataphracts_title: "Adopt the Cataphracts"
 grg_cataphracts_desc: "The Cataphracts - mounted warriors and hoofed beasts plated all over in the finest metal armour - were a staple of old Persia. Cataphracts struck fear in the hearts of our rivals of old, shattering Roman legions and rebel rabble alike with impunity. So successful were they that the remnant Romans of later ages adopted our tactics, seeking to copy us - admittedly, to great effect. Let us revive this monster of the battlefield!"
 grg_elephants_title: "Reintroduce War Elephants"
 grg_elephants_desc: "Our army's efficacy has reached new heights. Intelligence, boldness, power and determination - our armies are known for these traits, led now by generals with decades of experience, fashioned into hordes of fearsome Cataphracts and brutal infantry. With this restored might, it is only fitting that we restore yet another pillar of our fallen legacy - the dreaded war elephant. The bones of our enemies shall be pounded to dust beneath their might!"
 grg_immortals_title: "Revive the Immortals"
 grg_immortals_desc: "Our proud history has been muddied and diluted over time. Legends stand out however - paramount among them, that of the Immortals. Recalled by ancient Persian and Roman scholars alike, the Immortals were fierce heavy infantry of great standing, numbering 10,000 at any given time, no more, no less. In service, they guarded not only our ruler, but the empire as a whole. With our military might and burgeoning empire, it seems right that we revive this legend and make our enemies cower!"
 grg_great_wall_title: "Reinforce the Great Wall"
 grg_great_wall_desc: "Our great founder Togha Temur picked his stronghold well, Gurgan has been a fortress since Parthian times, and made impregnable during the Sassanids. For centuries it played a key role in the great wall holding back the peoples of steppe from Iran. If we are to last, reinforcing this wall is a priority."
 grg_eternal_title: "Rekindle the Eternal Flame"
 grg_eternal_desc: "Our faith has long been neglected by Muslim oppressors - many devout followers, even members of the clergy, have forgotten the ancient texts. Centres of religious learning shall be built or repaired across the nation; for the faith!"
 grg_gunpowder_empire_title: "A Gunpowder Empire"
 grg_gunpowder_empire_desc: "Gunpowder. The world wants it, every major state desiring its destructive power, including ours. Our artillery shall outshine that of any other country, projecting us into the future of warfare."
 grg_seat_title: "Seat of the Shahanshah"
 grg_seat_desc: "Persia bows before us, yet our capital does not stand as high as it should. From the hot sands of Cairo to the distant silk-laden east, it is known that marvellous, empowering capitals spring up where rightful, legitimate kings reign. We must waste no more time - our Shahanshah deserves a proper capital!"
 grg_mountain_expansion_title: "Mountain Expansion"
 grg_mountain_expansion_desc: "The Persian highlands have been undervalued by every dimwit warlord who tried pacifying them - not wasteland, nay, but the jumping point for the greatest cities in the world, closest to Heaven and sprawling across it. It is about time we show our dull neighbours how it's done."
 grg_silk_bazaar_title: "Expand the Trade Networks"
 grg_silk_bazaar_desc: "With the decline of Mongol power and the breakup of Persia, the wealth of the silk road has dried up considerably. In aeons past, the riches of Asia flowed from and to Persia, and with our patronage that wealth can once again be ours."
 grg_industrial_title: "Industrial Powerhouse"
 grg_industrial_desc: "At last, industrialization has come to Persia. The highlands, rich in natural resources, shall be brought to their full extent under our careful administration, for the explicit purpose that it be known: through all hardships, Persia is here to endure the fires of the world's furnace and, forevermore, harden in response."
 grg_textile_industry_title: "Persian Textile Industry"
 grg_textile_industry_desc: "Our textile industry, chief in all of the East, is world-renowned, but it risks being overshadowed by English or Iberian manufactories lest we subsidise it heavily."
 grg_persian_court_title: "Splendid Court"
 grg_persian_court_desc: "What sort of monarch would [Root.Monarch.GetName] be, if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not surround [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimselfCap] with the finest advisors money can hire?"
 grg_gondeshapur_title: "Academy of Gondeshapur"
 grg_gondeshapur_desc: "The Academy of Gondishapur was one of the three Sasanian centres of education, next to the likes of Ras-al Ayn and fair Ctesiphon, as well as the most important centre of medicine in the ancient world. Its renovation could be the first stepping stone for a rebirth of Persian culture and science."
 grg_educate_masses_title: "Educate the Masses"
 grg_educate_masses_desc: "There is no honour in ruling over a mass of peasants and ignorant degenerates, and our enlightened state can afford to pay for buildings fit to raise every Persian into a potential great priest, diplomat or general."
 grg_patronize_title: "Patronise Science"
 grg_patronize_desc: "Our neighbourhood, the Steppes to the north and the sands of Arabia to the south, is known for great conquerors, but not as much for great scientists and patrons. Our leverage lies in the technological advantages our government prides itself on, and we must make use of it."
 grg_government_modern_title: "A Modern Government"
 grg_government_modern_desc: "Our state must look to make its administration as efficient as possible, no longer relying on hearsay from listless delegates or tribal leaders but making use of state-of-the-art facilities across the entire empire."
 grg_iranzamin_title: "Iranzamin"
 grg_iranzamin_desc: "Having reformed our religion, court, and state, it is only natural that adopt a new identity as a nation. Henceforth, the world will know Iranzamin as the only successor to the ancient Achaemenid Empire, and the true suzerains of Iran."

 tradition_of_conquest2: "The Tradition of Conquest"
 tradition_of_conquest2_desc: "Conquering people can be a tricky business, not everyone is ready for our enlightened government. Still we have discovered that there are easier ways than building a mountain of skulls to bring people into our empire. It is something that our ancestors never learned."
 mgs_first: "Turn the Other Cheek"
 mgs_first_desc: "When our many enemies descend upon us like vultures, only to find themselves lost in the vastness of our steppe, they often turn to our subjects for food, for shelter, and even for information. Fortunately, our pious subjects do as the Lord Jesus commanded, turning the other cheek; away from them and toward our own brave soldiers who are truly in need."
 mgs_second: "The Holy Horde"
 mgs_second_desc: "Since our conversion by the most pious of Mongols St. Timur the Lame, we have ceased from a large part of our ruthlessness toward conquered people within our realm. Of course, we are still a horde - but long gone are the days of Pyramids of Skulls, as was our ancestor Temujin’s custom. Our subjects, as well as our neighbors, take notice of this clemency, and in the long term it allows us to get away with far more than in our misguided pagan past. "
 mgs_third: "Ceaseless Border Wars"
 mgs_third_desc: "Boxed in between the Grey Horde, various Turkic khanates, the Pashtuns and Empire of China, our warriors have plentiful opportunities to test their skill in battle, and this has forged our armies into a formidable fighting force"
 mgs_fourth: "Custodians of St. Timur's Tomb"
 mgs_fourth_desc: "St. Timur was one of the most holy men in all of Asia, and now his tomb - as well as his extensive collection of monastic literature - is in the possession of our Khanate. We should honor his legacy by renovating his tomb and copying his works, so that all may know our state’s dedication to the Lord."
 mgs_fifth: "The Tradition of Conquest"
 mgs_fifth_desc: "As the last descendants of the Chagatai Khanate, scions of the great empire of Ghengis himself, conquest sings in our blood - nay, our very being! Centuries of trampling the kingdoms of men under our hooves have given us a historical prerogative that few can match, and as the trumpets sound and the horses ride, we shall make full use of it."
 mgs_sixth: "Scheming Nobility"
 mgs_sixth_desc: "A king deposed, a civil war between uncle and nephew, a bastard son rising and carving out a kingdom of his own; factionalism between the ruling families of horde and Shahdom has been at the heart of our state since it first rode out from the steppe. With labyrinthine webs of loyalties and conflicts keeping sharp both blades drawn in the sun and daggers drawn in the night, the schemes of our nobility give our state an edge at intrigue that few can match."
 mgs_seventh: "Baptismal Records"
 mgs_seventh_desc: "As per Christian tradition, once a church baptizes someone - usually from birth - our local priests dutifully record their name in a book stored inside the church itself. This has an unexpected bonus for our government - it makes it far easier to know where to look for fresh conscripts, as well as catch those who attempt to dodge their orders, greatly expanding our pool of recruits to choose from. "

# Reforms #
 mgs_ferghana: "Ferghana Horses"
 mgs_ferghana_desc: "The celestial dynasties of the East have often prized inward perfection above all else; for nothing, in their eyes, could surpass the goods of China. Nothing, that is, but the Heavenly Horses of Ferghana. Prophesied in the Book of Changes, and desired by the greatest of eastern emperors, the nigh-mythical breeds of the Ferghana Valley are renowned for their speed and endurance. Establishing organised breeding programs and formalising a corps of horse trainers will allow us to expand our supply of this most prestigious of breeds to furnish our entire cavalry force."
 ab_holy_horde_reform: "Holy Horde"
 ab_holy_horde_reform_desc: "Tarmashirin’s Woe was the due our people reaped when our ancestors so sinfully cast out the messengers of Christ. As we were beaten, humiliated and cast down by the vengeful Khitan and Tocharian, it took the words of St. Timur to show us our wrongdoing and pride, and guide us towards the Light of the Lord. Repenting, we took up his godly banner and reforged ourselves in the image of the heavens. Now, with the arms of our ancestors we shall ride down those who wronged us with fire and righteous fury. Now, with the armour of Heaven we shall protect ourselves from falling to sin again. Now, we shall rise; a true Holy Horde."
 mgs_footsteps: "In Christ's Footsteps"
 mgs_footsteps_desc: "As Christ walked among the lowest of society, not seeking to chastise or punish but seeking to heal and feed, we cannot neglect the common man of our realm. Expenditures of state must be set aside for the poor and the hungry, so that we as a nation may walk this earth as Christ did."
 mgs_untoheathens: "Unto the Heathens"
 mgs_untoheathens_desc: "As St. Thomas went out unto the heathens to preach of Christ, so too must we follow. The Light of God must reach every quiet corner of the Earth, must illuminate every hallowed soul and darkened home, must be known and understood by all. We cannot rest until every member of our realm carries Christ with them."
 mgs_patriarchate: "Reorganize the Patriarchates"
 mgs_patriarchate_desc: "Our state is as much the machineries of the Church as it is the institutions of tribal allegiance and loyalty that came before it. By attaching a Patriarch to each major clan, we can leverage the influence the faith carries to ensure loyalty among the fractious tribes."

 ab_moghulistan.1.t: "The Restoration of Chagatai"
 ab_moghulistan.1.d: "The land between the Tarim Basin and the Oxus river was bequeathed by Chinggis Khaan to Chagatai, his second-born son. The Ulus of Chagatai has long since been divided, with various warlords propping up scions of the Chagatayid line as their puppets they combat each other for regional supremacy. Having firmly established our dominance, ending this era of division, we are in a position to claim the title of Khan for our own, restoring the Ulus of Chagatai in our own image."

 mgs_legacy_chagatai_title: "Legacy of Chagatai"
 mgs_legacy_chagatai_desc: "The Khanate of Chagatai, led by the descendants of Genghis Khan and hegemon over the Western Steppes, has long collapsed. It is our duty to pick up the pieces of this broken empire and rebuild it, stronger than ever before."
 mgs_tarim_title: "Tarim Incursion"
 mgs_tarim_desc: "The petty kings of China have defied our authority and laughed at our might for long enough! By invading the Tarim basin, we will have the necessary bridgeheads for a future invasion of China - and perhaps it will be our clique to fill the power vacuum."
 mgs_yam_title: "Rebuild the Yam"
 mgs_yam_desc: "An economic miracle, fruit of the Great Khan Ogedei's hard labor, the Yam has fallen into disuse after the empire lost its grasp on key trade centers. If we wish to take part in that prosperity, then we must act now and reconstruct it from the ground up."
 mgs_silk_road_title: "Control the Silk Road"
 mgs_silk_road_desc: "The Silk Road is a millenary pinnacle of Asia's trade network. It is high tide for us to take it over, once and for all, as to build a connection with the West and improve our impaired economy in one fell swoop."
 mgs_pearl_title: "Pearl of the Empire"
 mgs_pearl_desc: "Samarkand is the foremost city in our empire, as it was in the empire of our forefathers. To be a worthy successor, we must have a worthy capital."
 mgs_north_title: "Secure the North"
 mgs_north_desc: "Our Siberian neighbourhood is riddled with traitors, once our tributaries, now always prepared to raid our territory and sack our cities. To end this treachery, they too must fall under our armies."
 mgs_khitans_title: "Subjugate the Khitans"
 mgs_khitans_desc: "Once part of a greater khaganate, the Khitans have left behind the vestiges of Great Liao. They may not amount to much politically, but their horsemen would still be a valuable asset to our potent state."
 mgs_afghan_title: "Afghani Invasion"
 mgs_afghan_desc: "Afghanistan, doom of empires. The doorway to India, Bactria and the Persian gulf. While they are weak and disorganised, it would be wise to attack now and subjugate them, establishing ourselves as having gone one step further than most."
 mgs_khiva_title: "Control Khiva"
 mgs_khiva_desc: "Khiva is an important outpost to guard our western frontiers and a strategic location to retreat in the unlikely case we are defeated in Persia. It is also a renowned trade post, which would prosper from becoming part of our renovated Yam. That is, so long as we go and take it."
 mgs_restore_title: "Restore Chagatai"
 mgs_restore_desc: "We have fought, and we have won. The legacy of Chagatai Khan, written in the stars, is now in front of us, for everyone to see. It is time to make a step further. It is time to become the legacy we have fulfilled, and build our own."
 mgs_turkic_subjugation_title: "Defeat the Turkic Hordes"
 mgs_turkic_subjugation_desc: "The Steppe is a place of many peoples. Among them, the Turkic warlords have made for themselves an impressive name. Now they are all that stand in our way to glory, like many before. And like many before, they shall bend the knee."
 mgs_tomb_title: "Tomb of St. Timur"
 mgs_tomb_desc: "Not half a century ago, the East was visited by the pious and divine figure of Saint Timur the Great. To strengthen his already iron legacy, as the last to have been graced by his presence, it is our duty to renew his sepulchre and make it a place of worship and pilgrimage for all of his followers."
 mgs_church_east_title: "The Church of the East"
 mgs_church_east_desc: "The Nestorian faith is practically unheard of in the West, but it has become the paramount Christian identity among us people of the Steppe. Being the paramount Nestorian state, of course, we shall spread the word far and wide, and bring the gospel to every last one of the unenlightened."
 mgs_word_title: "Christianize the Tribes"
 mgs_word_desc: "In a place of religious syncretism and commercial enterprise, it often happens that ancient beliefs are hard to dislodge. By devolving many resources to proselytising, we will ensure the loyalty of our subjects in the long run."
 mgs_maharajas_title: "Defeat the Maharajas"
 mgs_maharajas_desc: "The Maharajas are potent rulers in their region, posing a significant military threat to our future expansion. They must be dealt with swiftly before they grow even stronger, forever towering over our realm."
 mgs_breaking_title: "Subjugate the Princes"
 mgs_breaking_desc: "The various princedoms think that they would be able to maintain their own independence, partaking in their own commercial and military activities. However, they are oblivious to our resurgent military capabilities. The princes must be subjugated and made a fine addition to our realm."
 mgs_persian_invasion_title: "Legacy of Hulagu"
 mgs_persian_invasion_desc: "We shall claim the legacy of Hulagu, a great Mongol Khan who managed to conquer much of Western Asia. His name shall live on forever with our tribe as we conquer the Persian polities."

 mgs_support_title: "Support the Horde"
 mgs_support_desc: "The horde is vast and is vulnerable to an overextended military frontline. Therefore we should improve our logistics in order to improve the capability of the horde to make war in general."
 mgs_tactics_title: "Modernized Mongol Tactics"
 mgs_tactics_desc: "It was quite the feat for the old Mongol empire to conquer much of the known world. Yet that was a few centuries ago, and our tactics are in need of modernisation. If we cling on to the old ways, we will not be able to restore the glory of the old empire."
 mgs_kinslayer_title: "The Kinslayer"
 mgs_kinslayer_desc: "The once great Mongol realm became divided amongst the descendants of the great Khan, and while that does make our rivals into our relatives, we will not show any mercy. For only through war with our kinsmen may we reunite the realm."

 mgs_rus_title: "Break the Heirs of Rus"
 mgs_rus_desc: "It seems that the princes of Rus' have forgotten the power of the Mongols. They are acting more and more freely ever since the collapse of the authority of the Golden Horde. This disobedience shall last no longer, we will break them and teach them who is their master."
 mgs_crimea_title: "Reintegrate Crimea"
 mgs_crimea_desc: "Crimea was once an important part of our conquests, granting us access to the Black Sea. However, now it is an independent realm, vulnerable to other great powers. We should seek to reintegrate Crimea so that the region would be protected."

 mgs_nchina_title: "The Middle Kingdom"

 mgs_korea_title: "Secure Korea"
 mgs_korea_desc: "Korea was an important military stronghold for the old Mongol empire, for it was used as a base for the naval invasion of Japan. Now this region has unfortunately lapsed out of our control. This must be rectified."
 mgs_manchuria_title: "Rein in the Jurchens"
 mgs_manchuria_desc: "The Jurchens was once a competitor in our conquest of China, leading their own Jin dynasty. Eventually they were conquered by us however it seems that as time passed the Jurchens are attempting to expand once again. This must be stopped."
 mgs_mongols_title: "Reuniting the Mongols"

 mgs_khanbaliq_title: "Capture Khanbaliq"
 mgs_khanbaliq_desc: "Situated in China, the city of Khanbaliq, or Shuntian, as the native Chinese call it, must be captured. Being the former capital of the collapsed Yuan dynasty, it would be in our best interest to reassert Mongol control."
 mgs_capital_title: "Reclaim the Old Capital"
 mgs_capital_desc: "The old capital of the empire must be reclaimed. How can we cling to the legacy of the great Khan without even owning the original capital of the Mongol horde?"

 ghu2_first: "Ghurid Cavalry"
 ghu2_first_desc: "Ghurid cavalry was composed of an amalgamation of Turko-Mongol slave soldiers, Afghan tribesmen, and Persian merceraries. This combination of effective mounted groups gave the Ghurids a decisive advantage against their more homogeneous neighbors."
 ghu2_second: "Persianate Bureaucracy"
 ghu2_second_desc: "Calling on the old administrative, legal, and social structures of the various Persian empires, The Ghurids retained a unified politcal organization centred on the organization of tribal groups into distinct estates within the bureaucratic apparatus. This semi-tribal structure would be further centralized by a century of adopted Persian and Indian bureaucratic practices."
 ghu2_third: "Destruction of Shahis"
 ghu2_third_desc: "Long have the lands to our east been the subject of the barbaric Shahis, and now we must look to end their lineage once and for all. The Buddhists of Afghanistan deserve proper leadership, not the division and tribal isolation they are in now. With the annihilation of Kabul will we be able to cement our strategic power over both east and west and secure our leadership of the Buddhists of Afghanistan."
 ghu2_fourth: "Into the Indus"
 ghu2_fourth_desc: "The rich lands of the Indus call to us, and the politcal fragmentation of the region will make it easy pickings for our army. Let us continue the long tradition of past Indo Iranian empires, and establish ourselves as great conquerers of India, starting with the Indus."
 ghu2_fifth: "The Court of the Buddhists"
 ghu2_fifth_desc: "Under the Kushans our lands where once considered to be the epitome of Buddhist culture, art, and learning. While the glory of the old empires has subsided much in recent year, we are still Buddhist. Let us seek to increase the patronage of the monks and show all travelers that the Bodhisattva is the supreme ruler of the land."
 ghu2_sixth: "Ghurid Imperial Destiny"
 ghu2_sixth_desc: "The great conquerors of old understood that conquest alone does not make an empire. Indeed, conquest itself stirrs resentment and unrest, and many of the largest empires tore themselves apart before they could ever hope to stabilize. Sound administration and cultural understanding are what keep empires alive, and therefore the governance of our lands is vital to our continued expansion. We shall unite both East and West; we shall not be a mere blip in the historical record, but rather a Ghurid Empire that will stand the test of time."
 ghu2_seventh: "Persianate Army"
 ghu2_seventh_desc: "Given the geographic location of the Ghurids, Persian influence has played a major role in the development of Ghurid culture, administration, and military. One major takeaway from Persian society was a professional army, and indeed such a force was vital in our victory over the Ilkhanate centuries ago. Unlike the tribal armies of our neighbors, we have increasingly employed a highly effecitve professional army based off of Persian models."

Sound administration and cultural understanding are what keep empires alive, and therefore the governance of our lands is vital to our continued expansion. We shall unite both East and West; we shall not be a mere blip in the historical record, but rather a Ghurid Empire that will stand the test of time."
 ghu_seventh: "Persianate Army"
 ghu_seventh_desc: "Given the geographic location of the Ghurids, Persian influence has played a major role in the development of Ghurid culture, administration, and military. One major takeaway from Persian society was a professional army, and indeed such a force was vital in our victory over the Ilkhanate centuries ago. Unlike the tribal armies of our neighbors, we have increasingly employed a highly effecitve professional army based off of Persian models." 

# Reforms #
 GHU_REFORMSHH: "\n§GUnlocks§! the §YBrahmin Administration§! Tier 6 government reform, granting us access to all §YIndian§! great projects."
 ghuriddynasty: "Ghurid Dynasty"
 ghuriddynasty_desc: "We, the Ghurids have many reasons to be proud of ourselves and our ancestry, not only were we the ones that freed Afghanistan from the Ilkhanate, we also still follow the Buddhist faith, that the other parts of Afghanistan have abandoned to worship Zun or Nestor, we know we're the rightful rulers of Afghanistan, all that's left to do is to prove it."
 ghuridempire: "Ghurid Empire"
 ghuridempire_desc: "Through our efforts to convert the population and through the adoption of different Persian customs, we have stopped being seen as foreign oppressors, being instead seen as the rightful rulers of Ehranshar. We have established ourselves as one of the many dynasties of Persia, the Ghurids." 
 ghutribal: "Ghuri and Khalaj Loyalties"
 ghutribal_desc: "Our realm is home to many fierce and powerful tribes, many of whom were a major factor in the foundation of our state to begin with. Among the most powerful of these are the Ghuri and Khalaj, and by securing their loyalties we would greatly increase the effectiveness of our armies."
 ghuzamburak: "Adopt the Zamburak"
 ghuzamburak_desc: "While the rise in cannon warfare is proving to be useful in other parts of the world, the mountainous nature of our lands need a lighter and more mobile fire power to be successful. By mounting minature cannons on camels, and having the camels then lay down to fire the guns, we can solve these logistical issues inherent of classical cannon warfare."
 ghueunuch: "Eunuch Recruitment"
 ghueunuch_desc: "As our empire expands, it is clear that tribal governance is not capable of mainting an effective state. Instead let us look towards the Persian adminstration, particulary their use of Eunuchs in the administrastion. Since they have no family or tribal loyalties, we can use them as valuable and more importantly loyal administrators in our ever growing empire."
 ghujahansuz: "Jahansuz"
 ghujahansuz_desc: "Our leaders have crushed all their enemies and reduced their cities to ash. While we prosper under their enlightened rule, our enemies quake with fear. They came to be known as 'Jahansuz', the world burners."

 ab_ghor.4.d: "While our rule over Persian has been long and prosperous, we are still seen as a foreign oppressor by many of this great land's inhabitants. While we are Iranians through and through, our tribal eastern ways are often not accepted amongst the majority of the western Persians. This has all changed with our vast patronage of Persian arts and science, religious unification under the Buddha, and vast building projects have all established us as a true Persian empire. We can now truly claim the title of Eranshahr."

 ghu_zunbils_title: "Purge the Zunbils"

 ghu_suren_desc: "The Khorasani Suren dynasty rule over our native people and threaten our southern flank. Unlike the Zunbils, the Surenas actually provide a threat to our state. The levies must be raised and this threat nipped in the bud before it could grow."

 ghu_conquest_desc: "To some, the right to rule comes from God, to others, the right to rule comes from the people. But we know better, we know that the right to rule comes from conquest. India has mostly abandoned the ways of Buddhism, but we will return. We are the strongest, the mightiest, the most worthy. India will be ours."

 ghu_persia_title: "Invade Persia" 
 ghu_persia_desc: "With Afghanistan united and our navy finally up and running, we can turn our attention to the lands of Persia.

Their divisions will be their weakness, and we will reign supreme over them all." 
 ghu_dudman_title: "Dudman-e Guriyan"

 ghu_new_path_desc: "The people of Iran have had many faiths over the thousands of years of their history. From Akkadian to Islam, many faiths have left their mark on the region. Now we will bring the light of the Buddha to the people, and they will find true Nirvana."

 ghu_patronize_desc: "Centuries of conflict and troubles have resulted in a cultural dark age for Persia.

 ghu_architecture_title: "Architectural Renovation"

 ghu_moghuls_title: "Subjugate the Moghuls"

 ghu_nalanda_desc: "The Nalanda university was the first and most influential Mahavihara university in India, but sadly centuries of conflict has resulted in much of it being ruined and destroyed.

 ghu_bengal_title: "Control Bengal"

 ghu_elephants_title: "Adopt the War Elephants" 
 ghu_elephants_desc: "War elephants provide unique strategies and advantages in warfare that it is a sad reality that they are really only found in India. Fortunately, we just so happened to conquer the entire subcontinent and have an abundant supply of war elephants to use for our own army. Imagine the looks on the cowardly European soldiers' faces when they see our majestic elephants crush them to death." 
 ghu_fortify_title: "Repair the Fortifications" 
 ghu_fortify_desc: "The greatest advantage we have is our natural terrain. Mountains and deserts make invading Afghanistan extremely difficult and frustrating. We should expand upon this and repair ancient fortifications all across the mountains to further frustrate and deter foreign threats." 
 ghu_graveyard_title: "Graveyard of Empires" 
 ghu_graveyard_desc: "Afghanistan has been known throughout history as the graveyard of empires. Every empire that has attempted to conquer us quickly fell apart. Our people refuse to yield to foreign threats, and will make sure every invader suffers and waste all their resources attempting to hold us. We will be unconquerable, like our ancestors before us." 
 ghu_fund_title: "Fund Buddhist Schools"

 ghu_cloth_title: "Expand the Cloth Industry"

 ghu_silk_road_title: "Monopolise the Silk Road" 
 ghu_silk_road_desc: "It is impossible to avoid our empire when travelling along the Silk Road, but sadly we are not exploiting the travelling merchants with nearly enough tolls.

 ghu_rebuild_title: "The Turquoise Mountain"

 ghu_statues_title: "Buddhas of Bamyan" 
 ghu_statues_desc: "The legendary Buddha statues that were once under Zun control have deteriorated over the years, and while we practise detachment from the physical, it still serves as a nice place to meditate. Therefore, to help motivate more of the faithful, we must renovate and refurbish this wonder." 
 ghu_cities_title: "Control the Trading Cities" 
 ghu_cities_desc: "Silk, one of the most valuable goods in history, has been traded throughout India for milenia.

 ghu_industrialize_title: "Industrialise the Production"

 trk_first: "Heirs to the Ashina"
 trk_first_desc: "Many a century ago, our clan was at the pinnacle of its power. We ruled the steppes from the Azov to Manchuria, but alas we were betrayed, divided, and cast into obscurity. Kulun Beg's deposition and flight to the Syr Darya cemented our humiliation, but we have not wallowed in vain pity. For centuries we have struggled in vain for power, but at last with the folly of the so-called Great Khan's sons, we have become free. And we shall plunder and subjugate anyone that dares to attempts to enslave us again!"
 trk_second: "Legend of Kur-Shad"
 trk_second_desc: "Kur-Shad, a nobleman of our clan, once raided the Chinese Emperor's palace with 40 loyal soldiers. Even knowing that he would die, he struck out boldly, never hesitating to strike fear into the enemy's heart. As the centuries have passed Kur-Shad has become a mythical figure, a symbol of our ferocity and honour passed down generation to generation. Turkestan now stands strong, and Kur-Shad's legendary heroics have only strengthened our perception and honour."
 trk_third: "The 10 Orders"
 trk_third_desc: "Under the wise leadership of Muqan Khagan, the Gokturk armies were divided into groups of 10, 100, 1000, and 10000, subdivinding his armies for more effective organization and a better command structure. This innovative system was mostly forgotten, but Istami Baghatur Khan's revival of the Ten Orders has seen us prevail in battles we were far outnumbered in. In a land so barbaric and lacking of discipline, we will dominate battles with our superior tactics!"
 trk_fourth: "Ambassador To The Sky Father"
 trk_fourth_desc: "Our rulers gain their legitimacy and right to rule from the Sky Father, Gok Tengri. Our people know that under his protection and the guidance of his ambassadors in the Asina clan they are safe and secure. Our kings rise to his heavens and claim glory from Tengri's blessed sword!"
 trk_fifth: "Animal Husbandry Traditions"
 trk_fifth_desc: "In the barren lands of Central Asia, it is neither profitable nor feasible to invest in large-scale agriculture. In the dry and cold steppes, we have become masters of animal husbandry. From our fine horsemanship to our reliable flocks, our skill at thriving on the steppes is second to none. With a moving shepard population, our armies and children are kept fed and happy."
 trk_sixth: "Otuken, the Moving City"
 trk_sixth_desc: "Once the beating heart of the steppes, Otuken was a moving and nomadic city a glory to own and behold. Even though the once great site stands now as little more than scattered ruins, salted by the Chinese in their conquest of our homeland, we have kept the memory of Otuken alive. And when we return, it shall stand once more as not a traditional city, but a mobile metropolis."
 trk_seventh: "Equality under the Blue Sky"
 trk_seventh_desc: "Unlike the other nomadic societies, our people and religion strongly believe that women as life-creators, should have complete equality with their spouses. Our women will march against enemies, not subservient to but alongside men, and indeed our armies will benefit from their participation and even leadership. Tengri does not discriminate or choose who shall be able to fight, everyone is welcome to join us as we pillage and burn the world!"

 trn_first: "Turco-Muslim Tradition"
 trn_first_desc: "The word Turkish has become synonymous with Muslim. Our fervour and dedication to the words of the Prophet and God is a defining feature of our state, as our support and patronage of mosques and numerous Sufi lodges can showcase. However, our empire is vast and large. In the homeland of the steppe, there are people who follow the old ways. They listen to the shamans for advice and guidance, and they perform rituals and traditions that are older than Seljuk himself. Instead of persecuting these individuals, we instead grant them amnesty and support – our empire is to be one of tolerance as well as piousness."
 trn_second: "A Union of Blood and Sword"
 trn_second_desc: "Our empire was formed through iron and steel, not through kind words and diplomacy. Our people are ready and willing to fight whatever foe might threaten our state. Be that an external enemy, or an internal foe, our people know what needs to be done in order to keep the dream of Turan alive."
 trn_third: "Turanian Nationalism"
 trn_third_desc: "The Turanian dream is such that all Turkish people can live in a strong, unified state. Our empire incorporates those of the steppe and those who settled in the cities of Anatolia. We are united in this dream of a powerful empire, and we shall work tirelessly to bring all Turkish people into the Turanian Empire."
 trn_fourth: "Legacy of the Steppe"
 trn_fourth_desc: "Our heritage is that of riders and warriors. We came riding in on our steeds, their hooves like thunder and neighs like the crashing wind. We were feared across the world, from the petty fiefdoms of Europe to the plains of India and even the great walled cities in China. Our cavalrymen shall continue this reign of terror, as our hordes of warriors ride into battle once more!"
 trn_fifth: "Bridging the Empire"
 trn_fifth_desc: "Our empire covers a truly massive amount of territory. From the steppes of Central Asia to the gates of Europe, our state is a sprawling conglomeration of people and cities. With an empire of this size, communication and travel times become a major hazard we must approach carefully. As such, we have established a series of major roadways and rest stops for diplomatic envoys, making even the most remote part of our empire accessible."
 trn_sixth: "Mamluk and Turkmen Armies"
 trn_sixth_desc: "The many slave soldiers within our empire were often either brought from the Steppe or established during our initial invasion in the 11th Century. Highly trained and efficient, these armies are the backbone of our military, able to switch from sedentary sieges to nomadic raiding tactics."
 trn_seventh: "Sons of the Conquerors"
 trn_seventh_desc: "Ever since the great Seljuk united the tribes of the Oghuz with the aid of the Sassanids, our forefathers have been warriors and kings alike. At the height of our power before the collapse, we controlled most of Anatolia, the Near East, and the Levant. Despite the fracturing of our empire in the 14th Century, the Turkish people rose up once more to dominate the land, spreading our empire across all who once opposed us. We are the sons of conquerors, and we shall continue what they started!"

# Events #
 ab_turkestan.2.t: "The Great Khan of Sarai" #Conquest of the Golden Horde 
 ab_turkestan.2.d: "The Golden Horde continues to crumble as the Khan and his retinue enter Sarai, a bustling city filled with bazaars, poets and scholars, the former capital of the once mighty western wing of the Mongol empire. The door to the Rus' and its vast fields of grass, grain and valuable furs lay open, ready to be subjugated under a new yolk, a Turkish yolk." 
 ab_turkestan.2.a: "A golden opportunity for further expansion!" 
 ab_turkestan.3.t: "The Extinction of the Shaybanids" #Conquest of the Grey Horde 
 ab_turkestan.3.d: "Devil worshippers, the lot of them! now that the authority of the Shaybanids over Central Asia has began to crumble and their cities have been laid to waste it is time to put the Shaybanids to the sword. Erlik is the root of evil and the spirits he unleashed on the world cause nothing but grief, ilness and misery, much like the Grey Horde which worships him. Gok Tengri put the people at ease when he stripped Erlik of his powers and now we will do the same with these harbingers of evil!" 
 ab_turkestan.3.a: "In the name of Gok Tengri I will punish you!" 
 ab_turkestan.4.t: "The Legacy of Seljuk" #Conquest of Persia 
 ab_turkestan.4.d: "When the great Seljuk fell the Turkic peoples were relegated to the borders of Iran, poor dessert lands in eastern Anatolia and Central Asia. The region fell to infighting before the Ilkhanate absorbed the region into the Mongol empire, after its collapse the great houses of Iran proceeded to squabble over the region once more.

 ab_turkestan.5.d: "The first Turkic Khaganate ruled much of the vast Eurasian steppe but was wracked with infighting and strife and ultimately split in two after the death of the 4th Khagan. The two halves continued to rule the steppes until the Treacherous Tang dealt a grievous blow to the Eastern Turkic Khaganate with the west following suit soon. Even the relatively short-lived Second Turkic Khanagate was reannexed by the Tang. While the Tang themselves are long gone their ilk still ruled from Beijing but with its conquest they have been repaid in kind ten times over for their duplicity."

 MNK_ideas_bonus: "Khiva Ambition"
 MNK_first: "Defend Against the Mongols"
 MNK_first_desc: "In the not so distant past, our armies were shattered, our cities desolated, and our people enslaved by the Mongol hordes. We must see to it that this will never befall us again. Let us look to new innovative tactics of battlefield fortifications, and heavily armoured soldiers in order to counter the Mongol horsemen and safeguard our realm from their savagery."
 MNK_second: "Manichaean Adherents"
 MNK_second_desc: "We are the last followers of the true faith, and the wisdom of Mani. Founded in the 3rd century AD by the Parthian Mani, the dualistic faith of light and dark would flourish during late antiquity, and along the silk road. The religion reached its heights during the Manichaean Uyghur Khanate, who dominated the silk road during the 8th and 9th centuries. With the collapse of the Uyghur empire the remaining Manichaeans would find their home in Khiva, were they dominate the region to this day. Despite everything and everyone, we are still here."
 MNK_third: "Refound the Chorasmian Medical School"
 MNK_third_desc: "Long before the Mongols burned their way through Chorasmia, the region was known for having some of the most renowned scientific centres in the world, the Chorasmian Medical School. Through patronage of native rulers, this school was one of the most important contributors to the study of medicine in the whole of Asia. Under our rule, we should look to refund and patronise this institution, and re-establish Khiva as the foremost scientific centre of the silk road."
 MNK_fourth: "Renovate Khiva"
 MNK_fourth_desc: "Once Chorasmia was home to some of the most splendid cities of the Silk Road, cities such as Urgench and Gurganj. While these days have long since passed, and the Mongol dominance has done its damage, we must seek to regain some of this old glory. Our new rulers shall build new cities starting with Khiva, and restore the irrigation systems and splendour of the old days."
 MNK_fifth: "Sogdian Connections"
 MNK_fifth_desc: "Since time immemorial, the Sogdians have greatly facilitated the silk road becoming as lucrative as it has become. If one is to dominate the wealth of Asia, the Sogdians must be involved. We should use our ties religiously, politically, and financially to incentivise Sogdian merchants to favour us when they come to trade their goods."
 MNK_sixth: "Persianate Society"
 MNK_sixth_desc: "While we may not be in Persia, Chorasmia has long had a strong connection to that great realm. From the Iranian dynasties that ruled Khiva, to our own Manichaean faith, which has strong persian elements itself, we view ourselves as part of Greater Persia. Let us continue this trend and make Persian language and customs the bedrock of our realm, whether it be culturally, administratively, or scientifically."
 MNK_seventh: "Establish the Vulboshi"
 MNK_seventh_desc: "Times are changing, and surrounded on all sides with enemies, we must seek to make a truly modern and professional military. By establishing a centralised command structure under the management of a group of top officials known as the Vulbushi, we can ensure our new army will be professionally trained, led, and supplied by an organised officer core. With these reforms, Khiva will dominate the other realms of Central Asia."

 CHS_second: "Fortify Against the Steppe"
 CHS_second_desc: "The wealthy realms of Transoxiana and Chorasmia have long been subject to frequent and devastating raids and conquests from the steppe, but this will happen no more. Inspired by the old fortifications of China and Persia, Chorasmia will too have its defensive line of fortresses and walls on its ever hostile border with the tribes of the vast steppe."
 CHS_third: "Persianate Court"
 CHS_third_desc: "Long have the great empires of Persia left their mark on our realm in every conceivable way. We must embrace this ancient legacy and adopt Persian as the language of our court. In this region, the language is Persian, and the kings of this realm are Persian kings."
 CHS_fourth: "Glory of the Silk Road"
 CHS_fourth_desc: "The lands of Chorasmia are the epicenter of the vast wealth of the Silk Road. From the lands of China, unimaginable riches flow into our grand cities as the caravans head further west into Persia, the Levant, and beyond. These routes have long provided us the wealth needed to forge powerful empires in this region."

These routes have long provided us the wealth needed to forge powerful empires in this region."
 CHS_fifth: "Storehouse of Wisdom"
 CHS_fifth_desc: "All of the great empires of our world create great centers of learning and culture, from Alexandria and Baghdad to great capitals of China and India, and Chorasmia shall have them too. Situated in the crossroads of east and west, we have the opportunity to attract scholars of all types to our court. With our patronage Chorasmia will become the center of science, mathematics, philosophy and much more, for centuries to come."
 CHS_sixth: "Urush Vaziri"
 CHS_sixth_desc: "It is clear that we can no longer rely on an army of levies and irregular tribesmen to defend our border from darkness. The great gunpowder empires of this age have begun to form professional cores of soldier let by qualified men, and Chorasmia will be no different. Let us start with creating a centralized command structure led by the Urush Vaziri or minister of war. Under his qualified leadership, we can start the process of forming a professionalized, state funded, and meritocratic military apparatus."
 CHS_seventh: "Gilded Cities"
 CHS_seventh_desc: "Since time immemorial, the staggering opulence of the great trade cities of Sogdiana and Chorasmia have dazzled the world. Despite the great desolation wrought by the hordes of the north and east, through our own great effort, these splendid cities have been restored. Once more, the paradise returns to Chorasmia."

# Events #
 mnk_flavor.1.t: "A Tribal Leader"
 mnk_flavor.1.d: "The tribes are dissatisfied with the Khan for failing to grasp the opportunities that arise for the benefit of Khiva and for his negligence of the growing concerns of the tribes. His dullness didn't help with the stagnation felt through Chorasmia, as towns struggle to prosper when nomadic raiders threaten every merchant with a pile of gold. This created a rift between the tribal leaders on the issue of leadership. One tribal chief had put forward an idea to overthrow the Khan and replace him with someone the tribes could control and steer in their way. While some argued that a puppet Khan would be even weaker than the current one, instead proposing confrontation as a means for him to take a more active role in leading the Khanate. Whatever path the tribes decide to take will determine the future of Khiva, for better or worse."
 mnk_flavor.1.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s time is up, he must be replaced"
 mnk_flavor.1.b: "He shows great promise. We will not listen to the tribes"
 mnk_flavor.2.t: "An Alliance Request from [From.GetName]"
 mnk_flavor.2.d: "Ever since Genghis Khan's invasion, relations with the Mongols have been tense. Even the successor states of the Mongol Empire, in an effort to achieve past glory, acted in an aggressive manner. Yet, feelings change over time, and coexistence could be made between those who seek it. Today, a messenger from the Golden Horde arrived at our court, which is nothing new as both rulers have been exchanging messages for a while. 'My lord, I bear a message from the Great Khan of the Golden Horde: Esteemed Khan of Khiva, may the heavens bless you with good fortune; furthermore, it came to my attention that our realms are cooperating more than ever, and I believe that this diplomatic mission is bearing fruit despite the increasing hostility of neighboring states. For this purpose, I bring forward the proposition to bind this accord with kinship and military alliance.' The Khan was surprised, raising his eyebrows as he heard the message. Silence fell throughout the hall for a second as the messenger awaited a reply."
 mnk_flavor.2.a: "This alliance will be of great benefit"
 mnk_flavor.2.b: "They are at the very least our tributary"
 mnk_flavor.3.t: "Fall of Turkestan"
 mnk_flavor.3.d: "Turkestan has always been Chorasmia's rival, as tribes have fought over Transoxiana since antiquity. But now Khiva is victorious, and Turkestan has fallen. The capital of Turkestan, Bukhara, was not spared; its buildings burned and its riches plundered. Even army generals voiced concern over the unnecessary destruction of the legendary Ark fortress, now in ruins. Soldiers are reported to be massacring adult males whenever they see them and enslaving the rest despite threats of disciplinary action. What happened in Bukhara can be repeated throughout Turkestan, erasing their heritage and culture from the land so that they will never rise and challenge Chorasmia ever again. Alternatively, integration might be a more favorable method that would benefit the country in the long run. History shows that treating people unjustly will only hasten the oppressor's downfall. The Turks can be accepted as the new subjects of the Khawarazmshah and put their craftsmanship and chivalry to use."
 mnk_flavor.3.a: "Treating them harshly will only backfire"
 mnk_flavor.3.b: "They were always our enemies. No mercy"

A zamburak consisted of a soldier on a camel with a mounted swivel gun hinged on a metal fork-rest protruding from the camel's saddle. To fire it, the camel was put on its knees. It provided heavy firepower and flexibility to the armies of many early-modern Persian states."

 AB_Shahi_Event.1.D: "With our conquest of western India all but secured, the rest of the subcontinent lies within our grasp! The last major question we must answer is how 'Indian' should we become? Many would think that our traditional ways are far superior to those of the Indians, while others think that there are many cultural aspects of the subcontinent that would be of great use to us should we decide to integrate ourselves more closely with India."
 AB_Shahi_Event.1.OPT1: "We shall strike fear into the heart of every Indian."

 AB_Shahi_Event.2.T: "The Tarim Basin"
 AB_Shahi_Event.2.D: "Our take over and development of the Tarmin Basin has not gone without controversy in our own court. Many of the wealthy trading families of the Tarim have come to our court asking us if it would not be better to let them run the region for us, freeing up our administration to pursue other goals. While leaving this region in hands of competent traders seems to be beneficial, others in court argue that it would weaken our standing abroad. "

 AB_Shahi_Event.4.T: "Afghan Silk"
 AB_Shahi_Event.4.D: "The development of industry in our provinces has been a major success! In an effort to improve the regions even further many of our advisors suggest bringing in silk to the regions, as it will surely provide much-needed economic stimulation.

 AB_Shahi_Event.4.OPT1: "We must fully invest in the Silk industry."
 AB_Shahi_Event.4.OPT2: "Let us encourage the local crafts instead."

However, a fierce debate has been sparked in our court over our identity after the Chinese mission. Since our founding, it is our tribal structure of government that gives us our strength and power, keeping us fierce and strong. While this is all good, many of our new advisors are questioning if retaining this way of life is the best for stability and central control, as after all with legitimacy from China, we no longer need tribal relationships to retain power."
 AB_Shahi_Event.5.OPT1: "The title of Shah fits the Shahids."
 AB_Shahi_Event.5.OPT2: "We can never abandon our tribal traditions and values."
 AB_Shahi_Event.7.T: "Commercial Giants of the East"
 AB_Shahi_Event.7.D: "As the world increasingly begins to adopt globalization, our prime center at the heart of the world economy allows us to use these many new ideas of trade and economics to flourish our empire long before they reach the other cities of the world."
 AB_Shahi_Event.7.OPT1: "The fruit of our labour."

 AB_Shahi_Field_Testing_desc: "While the tribal armies of our past can be of use, the time has come to take steps towards establishing a standing and professional army. Given our new found influence, we should start by finding a qualified advisor to teach us about the new ways of war."
 AB_Shahi_Threat_West_title: "Threat in the West"
 AB_Shahi_Threat_West_desc: "The fearsome realm of the Ghurids lies just to our east, so long as they continue to exist we will never be able to attain regional supremacy. A conquest of Ghor will not be easy however, as their horses are fast and their men are formidable. With this conquest secured, our dominance over western Asia will begin!"
 AB_Shahi_Ressurgent_Afghanistan_title: "Resurgent Afghanistan"
 AB_Shahi_Ressurgent_Afghanistan_desc: "With our unification of Afghanistan more or less complete, the many Afghan tribes are now discussing if they should select us as their offical leader at the helm of a new Afghan empire. In order to sway them further towards this decision, let us conquer the weaker Shahdoms to our south, which would not only show the tribes our strength but also provide strategic control over acess to India."
 AB_Shahi_Hindu_Shahis_title: "The Hindu Shahis"
 AB_Shahi_Hindu_Shahis_desc: "With Aghanistan unified, we should look towards expanding to richer lands elswhere. In times past, other Shahi dynasties once held sway over the western gateways to India controlling lands such as Kashmir, and with our military might an invastion of these vulnerable yet strategic lands would pave the way to much more lucrative conquests in the future."
 AB_Shahi_Gateway_Hindustan_title: "The Gateway to Hindustan"
 AB_Shahi_Gateway_Hindustan_desc: "With western access to the Subcontinent completely controlled by us, let us follow in the footsteps of men such as Alexander, Menader, and Kanishka and launch a full scale invasion of India.

 AB_Shahi_Assemble_Tribal_Host_title: "Assemble Tribal Host"
 AB_Shahi_Assemble_Tribal_Host_desc: "Surrounded on all sides by enemies, if we are to set forward on the path of power, we must start with raising an army. In order for us to gain such an army however, we must rally the tribes in our land towards our grand cause."
 AB_Shahi_Troublesome_Religion_title: "Purge the Zunbils"
 AB_Shahi_Troublesome_Religion_desc: "The heathens in our southern lands still practice their primitive and misguided faith. If we wish to become a powerful state in our own right, we must start with unifying our country under the teachings of the Buddhas, the Zunis must be purged."
 AB_Shahi_End_Zuni_Incursion_title: "End Zuni Incursions"
 AB_Shahi_End_Zuni_Incursion_desc: "The Zuni kingdom of Rob on our western border is a bastion of heathens and a thorn in our side. If we are to become a major power player, we must snuff out this wayward backwater. By doing this, we can begin to establish ourselves as the foremost power in eastern Khorasan."
 AB_Shahi_Our_Fair_Share_title: "Our Fair Share"
 AB_Shahi_Our_Fair_Share_desc: "For eons the wealth of the Silk road has flowed from China, through the Tarim and into our lands. However, the greedy Tocharian merchants take the lions share of the profits and leave us only scraps. This will no longer do, we must start to exert our control over this trading cities through conquest, and remove the middle men that stand between us and China."
 AB_Shahi_Tribal_Court_title: "Establish Tribal Courts"
 AB_Shahi_Tribal_Court_desc: "In an effort to advance our realm, we should look to slowly seperate tribal affairs with those of the state. Our advisors suggest we begin with granting the tribes their own courts to govern themselves with. While they will still be subject to the state's laws this will allow a more personal and local touch to our central governing and gives a strong core of local judges to use in our own court should we need them."
 AB_Shahi_Teachings_Buddha_title: "The Teachings of Buddha"
 AB_Shahi_Teachings_Buddha_desc: "In times past Kabul was a flourishing center of Buddhism in Asia. If we are to continue to develop our nation into a great power, we should seek to reinvigorate our subjects with the path of enlightenment."
 AB_Shahi_Higher_Buddhist_Education_title: "Higher Education"
 AB_Shahi_Higher_Buddhist_Education_desc: "With the Buddhism becoming more and more integral into our society, we are seeing renaissance of intellectual life brought on a by flourishing monastic culture.

 AB_Shahi_Safe_Haven_title: "A Safe Haven"
 AB_Shahi_Safe_Haven_desc: "Despite Buddhist orthodoxy being reinforced in our realm, this has not led to a lack of tolerance for other faiths. As tolerance is a core teaching of the Buddha, it is only right that we continue to tolerate those of faiths in our realm. As religious intolerance sweeps through other parts of the world, we will be a peaceful island in the middle of it, attracting a wealth of foreign knowledge and investment in the process."
 AB_Shahi_modernize_government_title: "Modernise the Government"
 AB_Shahi_modernize_government_desc: "While we have already advanced much in the ways of governing our realm, our old semi-tribal and feudal administration will no longer be able to cope with our growing empire. At the behest of our advisors, the time has come to overhaul our administration, and create a vast meritocratic bureaucracy ready to effectively deal with any future threats to our empire."
 AB_Shahi_Waystation_title: "Control the Tarim Basin"
 AB_Shahi_Waystation_desc: "Now that the strategically important area of the Tarim Basin is under our direct control, we should look towards developing this land into a highley valuable center of commerce.

 AB_Shahi_Artistic_Revival_title: "Artistic Revival"
 AB_Shahi_Artistic_Revival_desc: "Kabulistan was once the center of a thriving Buddhist and Vedic artistic tradition. Taking inspiration from the older Hellenistic-Buddhist art of antiquity our art also fused Indian, central Asian and Chinese art forms into dazzling sculptures, murals, and statues. This tradition has long since vanished with the destruction wrought by the Mongols. If we are to take our place amongst the great kingdoms, sponsoring this art once more would be a step in the right direction."
 AB_Shahi_Buildingblocks_Nation_title: "Architectural Expansion"
 AB_Shahi_Buildingblocks_Nation_desc: "Our lands may be rich in trade and resources, but it is poor and undeveloped. This will not do, and we should begin the process of improving the infrastructure and wealth of our realm. If we are to take our place amongst the other great powers, we must develop our own lands!"

 AB_Shahi_National_Treasure_desc: "While our economic power is increasing by the day, much of Afghanistan remains poor and produces only meager goods. Our next step in Afghan development should be to improve this situation in our outer provinces and sponsor large scale production enterprises in order to spur economic growth in these lands."
 AB_Shahi_Urbanization_title: "Urbanise the Country"
 AB_Shahi_Urbanization_desc: "In eons past we have been known as the Land of Ten Thousand Cities but, in reality the vast majority of our realm is unsuitable for large scale urbanization due to its harsh mountains and hot deserts. If we are to keep up with our more geographically gifted neighbors, large scale infrastructure and urbanization efforts must take place.

 AB_Shahi_Ambitions_Industrialization_desc: "The winds of change sweep through the world, and countries from Europe to China are begining to undertake massive societal changes, moving from agrarian socities to manufacturing based ones.

It is only just that we formalize this hegemony in the eyes of the rest of the world."
 AB_Shahi_Buddhist_Diplomacy_title: "Buddhist Diplomacy"
 AB_Shahi_Buddhist_Diplomacy_desc: "Ever since the mongol conquests, Buddhism abroad has been in a somewhat fragmented and isolated state. If we are to improve our prestige, we should look to reestablishing contact with our long lost brothers in faith."
 AB_Shahi_Confirming_Legitimacy_title: "Confirming Our Legitimacy"
 AB_Shahi_Confirming_Legitimacy_desc: "In order to be seen by the rest of the Asia as a great and formidable power, we must first establish ourselves as the legitimate rulers of our realm. In centuries past we once had the support of the Tang dynasty of China, on account of our shared Buddhist faith and location on the silk road. While the Tang have long since fallen, who could give better confirmation of our legitimacy then the dragon of the east?"
 AB_Shahi_Commercial_Power_title: "A Commercial Power"
 AB_Shahi_Commercial_Power_desc: "With our new found relations with China, and the our recent improvement to the development of our own lands, we should establish a stronger trade position abroad.

 AB_Shahi_Caravanserai_desc: "Our position as a crossroads of the world is known far and wide, and if we were to improve the infrastructure of travel in our country, then surely more caravans would begin to travel through us and more importantly pay our taxes."
 AB_Shahi_Global_Market_title: "Global Market"
 AB_Shahi_Global_Market_desc: "We should look to once again become the economic center of the world, as we were under the Kushans and Bactrians. This is not an easy task by any stretch of the imagination however, but if we became the most dominant trading power in both Persia and India we would surely set ourselves down the right path towards economic dominance."
 AB_Shahi_Center_World_title: "Center of the World"
 AB_Shahi_Center_World_desc: "With our influence in the global markets of Asia secured, we should use this new found power to re-center global trade in Afghanistan. Soon again, King, Khan, and Emperor will covet the land of ten thousand cities!"

 GRH_first: "Successors to Shiban"
 GRH_first_desc: "We are the heirs of Shiban, founder of the Grey Horde and son of Jochi himself, and younger brother to Batu Khan. Shiban would particpate in numerous decisive battles in Europe, alongside his brothers and father before finally being granted land in the east of Batu's empire. Shiban's line would remain strong, and after Batu's line ended, several Khans of the Golden Horde would be of Shibanid lineage. We are still here, and we are still strong."
 GRH_second: "Kipchak Hegemony"
 GRH_second_desc: "With the decline of the old realm of the Jochids to our west, we have become the most dominant and stable successor to the old Mongol empire in the Kipchak steppe. It is our birthright to re-unify the empire of Jochi and Batu under the banner of Shiban, and strike terror into the hearts of Europe once more."
 GRH_third: "The Bright Road of Shiban Khan"
 GRH_third_desc: "Instituted in the early 16th century, the 'Bright Road of Shiban Khan' would be the first written Kazakh law code in history. Based of Persian, Mongol, and Buddhist scripts, the code would stablize and define the Grey Horde, and lead to creation of a much more centralized realm in the future."
 GRH_fourth: "Reconquer the Southern Oases"
 GRH_fourth_desc: "The rich and powerful Oasis Cities of Transoxiana, Khwarazm, and Khorosan call to us. For a brief period, we controlled large swaths of this land during the collapse of the Chagataids, we lost it soon after. We must rally the warriors and ride towards conquest once more!"
 GRH_fifth: "Crossroads of Asia"
 GRH_fifth_desc: "Situated in the heart of central Asia, we have access all of the cross continental trade of the whole of Europe and Asia. This gives us much control over the flow of wealth of the Northern Silk road and it is a major source of our income to this day."
 GRH_sixth: "Kazakh Golden Age"
 GRH_sixth_desc: "With our powerful and dominant position as foremost Western Mongol successor, we should seek to create a splendid and settled court, as Ozbeg and Kublai Khan once did. By patronizing scholars and monks, along with building new monuments across our empire, we will bring the lands of Shiban to a great era of prosperity!"
 GRH_seventh: "Forged by Rivals"
 GRH_seventh_desc: "We have long been surrounded on all sides by enemies, and with very few natural barriers to their agression, we are in almost constant conflict.

 znn_fifth_desc: "From Zun's great shrine in the mountains overlooking Zamindawar does the High Priest of the Sun call the faithful - commending Zun's wisdom and beckoning all to recognise his power. With our conquests, the high priest's voice will reach beyond the peaceful valleys of Zamindawar and penetrate the unfaithful world." 
 znn_sixth: "Control the Mountain Passes"
 znn_sixth_desc: "Our rocky homeland has given us valuable experience. Our legs are hardened from the treacherous ascents up our ancient cliffs. Our mules are disciplined and wise. Our skills to create and remember routes of utmost efficiency and safety will prove insurmountable in conquering the trade networks of Greater Persia."
 znn_seventh: "Glory of the Zun"
 znn_seventh_desc: "Since ancient times, we have often set out from our mountain holdings to inspire fear in our enemies. The glory of Zun, the fire in our hearts which he has instilled in us, the roar in our throats which makes mountains rattle - all shall make short work of our rivals and inspire faith in the great Zun."

# Reforms #
 zundivine: "Divine Justice"
 zundivine_desc: "The will of Zun is absolute, and the law of the Arbiter of Justice is inerrant. The Great Purification is upon us all, and it is our duty to follow Zun's guidance and take up arms in the name of all that is radiant and good. Obedience and loyalty to Zun's will is the truest path of all Zunists, and the carrying out of his justice upon the nonbelievers is therefore our duty."
 zunroutes: "Expand the Mountain Routes"
 zunroutes_desc: "Afghanistan is one of the highest places in the world, and while our closeness to Zun grants us spiritual fulfilment, alas our lands are rough and hard to traverse. Over the centuries we have become masters at travelling across the high peaks and narrow passes, but without proper infrastructure our lands are closed to much foreign trade that could otherwise pass through our great cities. Developing and expanding the old and worn roads through our territory is therefore paramount to our trade interests."
 zunadministration: "Perso-Indian Administration"
 zunadministration_desc: "Our state has grown much, but in order to effectively govern we must learn from the mistakes of our predecessors. Through Zun's providence we shall set up administrators not unlike satraps, drawn from tribes and clans far-flung from their satrapies. By creating a class modelled on the Poligars of India, we can create an administrative apparatus both fair and stable, and prevent the tribalism and dynastic power struggles that plagued the Persians and Indians."
 zunradiant: "Radiant State"
 zunradiant_desc: "Through the divine guidance of the chosen priesthood of Zun, the state shall be a beacon of wisdom and justice. The Radiance of Zun shall shine to all corners of the world, and peace and prosperity shall abound."
 zunfortress: "Fortress Zun"
 zunfortress_desc: "As empires come and go, as new powers arise in Persia and India and seek to conquer our lands, we must remind ourselves that our survival for nearly a millennium is no mistake. While others sought to subjugate and conquer lands, we became the impenetrable fortress of the mountains, walled citadels and forts keeping invaders at bay. As we stride into the future we should not forget our great and terrible walls, dashing the hopes of any who see us as an easy target. Fortress Zun is an immovable barrier under the scorching sun, the shield of the righteous; invaders shall think twice before stepping foot in our lands. We are the rock on which empires break and nations crumble."
 zunsilk: "Silk Road Trading Hubs"
 zunsilk_desc: "Situated on the middle of the Silk Road, our nation is in a prime position to benefit from the expansion of trade in the area. By maintaining caravan guards, sponsoring trade guilds, and expanding the great markets within our borders, we can manage and even control the flow of people and goods along the Silk Road."
 zunjustice: "The Giver of Justice"
 zunjustice_desc: "The High Priest of the Zunist faith has traditionally borne the title 'Giver of Justice,' second only to Zun under the law and tasked with the power to both rewrite and enforce laws according to Zun's will. However, over the centuries the clerical duties of the priests overshadowed their legal role, and the title now lay derelict and unused. Zun The Arbiter of Justice is of course supreme, but perhaps making sure Zun's justice is enforced would be wise. By separating the titles of High Priest and Giver of Justice, we can more effectively manage our growing administration, and perhaps make the High Priest's job easier as well."

# Events #
 ab_zun.1.t: "Rename the Country"
 ab_zun.1.d: "This event allows us to change the name of our country to one of the following options:"
 ab_zun.1.a: "Empire of Zun"
 ab_zun.1.b: "Zabulistan"
 ab_zun.1.c: "I've changed my mind"
 ab_zun.2.t: "Sunset Over the Empire"
 ab_zun.2.d: "As the last of the squabbling Iranian princedoms is crushed, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] turns to a new task. The Zoroastrians constantly threatened our independence time and time again, and now they grovel at the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s feet, begging for mercy, begging for a clemency they will never receive. For just as the Zoroastrians have their fire temples, so too do Zunists revere fire, and soon thousands of pillars of smoke are seen rising into the evening sky over Persia, leaving little but ashes behind.\nAs the Sun sets over Eranshahr, a new Shahanshah emerges like dawn to take their rightful place, and soon all of Persia shall be cleansed in the name of almighty Zun."
 ab_zun.2.a: "A new Sun rises over Persia"
 ab_zun.3.t: "Master of India"
 ab_zun.3.d: "Centuries ago, the followers of Zun were cast from India, forced to flee westwards towards the high hills and mountains of the Hindu Kush. Now, with the whole subcontinent under our benevolent rule, we have reunited with our brethren and shown them the true way. As the Sun standard of $FROMCOUNTRY$ now flies from Bengal to Gujarat, from Doab to the Deccan, India is at last wholly united under a new master. Now we shall look to a future which shines ever brighter, Zun's rays amplifying the magnificent crown jewel of our empire, India!"
 ab_zun.3.a: "India has but one Master, and it is us!"

 ab_zunist.1.t: "Solar Eclipse"
 ab_zunist.1.d: "The heavens above our glorious capital were illuminated by a radiant light as Zun cast his divine gaze upon our land. But alas, as swiftly as his brilliance graced us, darkness swept across the realm. This moment lasted mere minutes, yet its impact has kindled panic that threatens to engulf us for months, perhaps even years to come.\n\nSome perceive the event as a sacred sign from Zun himself, yet its significance is hotly debated among the faithful. Has our God abandoned in our people? Some even whisper behind closed doors that our ruler has committed an unforgivable sin.\n\nAs the populace grapples with this sign from the heavens, chaos has gripped our nation, its tendrils reaching every corner of our land. Fear and unrest have taken root, disrupting the tranquillity that once reigned over our prosperous realm."
 ab_zunist.1.a: "Stop looking at the sky!"
 zunist_festival1: "Festival of the Sun"
 zunist_festival2: "Festival of the Sun"
 ab_zunist.2.t: "Festival of the Sun"
 ab_zunist.2.d: "Across the land festivals are being held in the honour of the Justice Bringer, Zun. Faithful gather from near and far to partake in this grand celebration in the honour of the Sun God, creating an atmosphere of jubilation and reverence. Naturally, we may decide to promote the festivities, appeasing both the people and high priesthood, should we desire."
 ab_zunist.2.a: "Let us not be frugal, blessed be the Sun God!"
 ab_zunist.2.b: "We can spare some funds"
 ab_zunist.2.c: "This is none of our concern"
 zunist_scorching: "Scorching Sun"
 ab_zunist.3.t: "The Scorching Sun"
 ab_zunist.3.d: "Our enemies, who dare to invade our lands, find themselves subjected to the harsh and scorching rays and merciless wrath of Zun. The invaders suffer in their every breathing moment, many dying to heat, exhaustion or dehydration. This clear display of divine retribution casts a warning to those who would dare challenge us and strengthens the faith of our people in the war."
 ab_zunist.3.a: "Zun’s justice is as mighty as his wrath"
 warriors_of_zun: "Warriors of the Sun"
 ab_zunist.4.t: "Warriors of the Sun"
 ab_zunist.4.d: "Among the most zealous ranks of Zun's faithful, a warrior society emerges, known as 'The Warriors of The Sun', they embody the virtues of bravery, justice, and unwavering faith in the radiant light of Zun. Renowned for their ferocity when faces the forces of darkness, these ironlike men stand ready to lend their strength should our realm be in conflict with the infidel."
 ab_zunist.4.a: "Blessed be Zun and his warriors!"
 ab_zunist.5.t: "Zun's Trials"
 ab_zunist.5.d: "Various traditions and beliefs, testing one’s endurance and faith to Zun have been passed down for centuries amongst the many Zunist communities within our nation and across the world. Among them are Zun’s trials, which include living in an inhospitable environment (often a desert) for three days and three nights. Those who survive the test are surely blessed by Zun himself. Recently, our heir [Root.Heir.GetName] has taken an interest in undertaking these trials, no matter the risk to his life."
 ab_zunist.5.a: "Let him prove his faith!"
 ab_zunist.5.b: "Stop this madness!"

# Missions #
 zun_zunbils_title: "Reunite the Zunbils" 
 zun_zunbils_desc: "The Zunbils of Afghanistan have slowly faded into near obscurity. The last few remnants remain in the desolate mountains, far from any unifying force. The Zunbils can not fall; we will not let them. Rob will lead the unyielding Zuns into a glorious future, one where all of Persia can bathe in the light!" 
 zun_overpower_title: "Overpower the Neighbours" 
 zun_overpower_desc: "To state that we are weak would be a major understatement. Compared to our neighbours in the region, we have less troops, less wealth, less land, and less allies. Our first and most important priority is to ensure our survival by conscripting every peasant who can hold a sword into the military. Hopefully that will scare off our greedy neighbours." 
 zun_rebuild_title: "Rebuild Ghazni" 
 zun_rebuild_desc: "Ghazni was one of the most important cities in all of ancient Persia. It served as a crossroads between the Middle East and India. After years of conquests and sackings, it is nothing more than a small village built around great citadels and ruins. Ghazni must be rebuilt as the centre of our new empire, linking the east and west once again." 
 zun_unite_title: "Unite Afghanistan" 
 zun_unite_desc: "Afghanistan has not been unified by Afghans for centuries. Foreign invasions and collapse have left little of a united Afghan state. Rob will fix that. All of Afghanistan will soon be praising the Zun as we prove ourselves the new power of Persia." 
 zun_sunset_title: "Sunset Over the Empire" 
 zun_sunset_desc: "The Persian Empire has been in anarchy ever since the initial Muslim invasion all those years ago; while many have come and attempted to unite such a diverse empire, they have all failed. The Light of Zun will set things right. The once proud and mighty Persian Empire has finally settled under the horizon, but Zun has just begun to rise." 
 zun_persia_title: "Invade Persia" 
 zun_persia_desc: "With Afghanistan united, our next goal should be the invasion of Persia to our west. While these lands have been devastated many times in recent memory, there is still some wealth left. We cannot afford to let our rivals claim that wealth for themselves. They will taste the wrath of our Burning Crusades!" 
 zun_merv_title: "Conquer Merv" 
 zun_merv_desc: "The Princedom of Merv is one of the most fortified and impregnable statelets to emerge in the Persian anarchy. Their grand fortress and inhospitable environment means most invading armies die of heat stroke before ever facing their foes. We are different. We are Rob. We do not fear the sun. We embrace it." 
 zun_fortify_title: "Repair the Fortifications" 
 zun_fortify_desc: "The greatest advantage we have is our natural terrain. Mountains and deserts make invading Afghanistan extremely difficult and frustrating. We should expand upon this and repair ancient fortifications all across the mountains to further frustrate and deter foreign threats." 
 zun_graveyard_title: "Graveyard of Empires" 
 zun_graveyard_desc: "Afghanistan has been known throughout history as the graveyard of empires. Every empire that has attempted to conquer us quickly fell apart. Our people refuse to yield to foreign threats, and will make sure every invader suffers and waste all their resources attempting to hold us. We will be unconquerable, like our ancestors before us." 
 zun_cloth_title: "Expand the Cloth Industry" 
 zun_cloth_desc: "One of the most valuable trades in the Indus valley is the cloth trade. Wool has become such a valued commodity that nations as far as Europe seek Indian clothing. We need to control such a profitable trade and expand it to meet the ever growing demand." 
 zun_silk_road_title: "Monopolise the Silk Road" 
 zun_silk_road_desc: "The Silk Road is ancient, with thousands of years of history and commerce having left major impacts on all stops. Not since the time of the Mongols has one nation truly dominated the Silk Road. Now, we have been presented the opportunity to control the Silk Road. We cannot let this opportunity go." 
 zun_cities_title: "Control the Trading Cities" 
 zun_cities_desc: "The most important part to maintaining our hegemony over the Silk Road is the control of vital trade cities across it. Without these trade cities, the road will either become unsafe, or be replaced by other routes that are more profitable. This network of trade cities will be expanded upon and turned into the centre of all global trade." 
 zun_industrialize_title: "Industrialise the Production" 
 zun_industrialize_desc: "Despite how valuable the cloth industry is, it is still costly to produce the cloth in the first place. Fortunately, the power of the sun is now in the palm of our hands, as new techniques allow for production rates to skyrocket. Production shall increase and so shall our profits!" 
 zun_coast_title: "Reach the Coast" 
 zun_coast_desc: "We spend so much time worshipping the sun in our mountains and deserts that we have not really focused on our navy. Sadly, ships cannot be used to cross the desert, but they can help project power in the surrounding area. In order for the world to fear the mighty Rob, we must first find a way to access the sea. The region of Makran is the perfect place to start." 
 zun_kashmir_title: "Control Kashmir" 
 zun_kashmir_desc: "The most crucial intersection of cultures and trade occurs in the region of Kashmir. China, India, Persia, and all the near east rely on Kashmir for wealth, with the only other option being the treacherous Indian ocean. The light of Zun shines on all, and it is our destiny to unite all land that Zun blesses." 
 zun_valley_title: "Descend into India" 
 zun_valley_desc: "Now that we control all that flows in and out of India, the next goal is to begin our invasion. The Indus River was once the border of Macedonia under Alexander, and now it shall become just one piece of our growing Zunist empire." 
 zun_rajputana_title: "Unite Rajputana" 
 zun_rajputana_desc: "The Rajas of India have been fighting for centuries, and this infighting has weakened them to foreign invasion. Imagine the consequences if one of the Europeans came in and conquered India from them. Fortunately, we are here to save the day. The Rajputs will love to praise the Zun." 
 zun_accommodate_title: "Accommodate the Rajputs" 
 zun_accommodate_desc: "The Rajputs maintain significant influence despite our conquest. While we could just take care of them the old fashioned way, it would be easier and more beneficial to recruit them into our army. The Rajputs will fight for Zun and spread our light all across India." 
 zun_court_title: "Perso-Indian Court" 
 zun_court_desc: "Persian ways of thinking and Indian ways of thinking have not always gone hand in hand, but it would be idiotic of us to deny the Indians a seat in our government just because of their race. Indians and Persians will walk together as the united superpowers of the world." 
 zun_gujarat_title: "Gujarati Trade Ports" 
 zun_gujarat_desc: "The trade ports of Gujarat are the most valuable in the Indian Ocean trade network; though we are already drowning in money, a little more could not hurt. Plus, it would deny our rivals the money as well." 
 zun_north_title: "Rein in the North" 
 zun_north_desc: "The region of Hindustan has become a hodgepodge of cultures over the past few centuries of Islamic invasions. Our biggest fear could be that one day they will finally unite and throw the world into the shade, blotting out our great Zun. To prevent this, we must crush them first. First the north, then the rest of India." 
 zun_deccan_title: "Supremacy over Deccan" 
 zun_deccan_desc: "The Tamil kings and other rulers of Deccan maintain trade hegemony between India and the Spice Islands. While we control all trade from Arabia towards the eastern coast, they still profit the most from the elusive spice trade. This will not stand any longer. The last bastions of Hinduism and Buddhism in India will be erased by the light of Zun." 
 zun_bengali_title: "Bengali Domination" 
 zun_bengali_desc: "One of the most populous places on the planet, the Bengali region could outproduce anywhere with enough investment. Of course our conquest will also spread the light of Zun to these people. So it is a win-win for both our priests, and our merchants." 
 zun_master_title: "Master of India" 
 zun_master_desc: "We have done it, no foreign power will ever set foot on our own personal subcontinent. We, the Zuns, have conquered the unconquerable. No other nation on Earth has the might, nor the prestige to control it. We are not just some weird cult organised around the sun. We are not some backwards incestuous bastards that can barely adminster a realm. We are the Zuns, we are the masters of India." 
 zun_integrate_title: "Integrate the Hindus"
 zun_integrate_desc: "Our vast empire now covers much of the Indian subcontinent. If we wish to stabilize our Empire and prevent internal unrest, integrating the Hindu population and treating them as our equals should be our top priority."
 zun_shrines_title: "Patronise the Shrines" 
 zun_shrines_desc: "Local shrines to Zun dot all across our fledgling empire. Sadly, these shrines are unorganised and lack a cohesive doctrine to preach. Patronising these local shrines and turning them into pilgrimage sites for our faithful will help unify the followers of Zun." 
 zun_wrath_title: "Wrath of the Zun" 
 zun_wrath_desc: "The world looks upon Zun with pity and hatred. The Zoroastrians think of us as a weird cult, the Muslims view us as disgusting heathens, and the Christians all the same. Yet we stand before them not as equals, but as superiors. They will fear the Wrath of Zun, as our crusaders scorch their countryside with the might of the Zun."

 ZKD_first: "The Daylamites"
 ZKD_first_desc: "The Daylamites were a warlike people that inhabited the southern parts of Gilan on the Caspian sea. Skilled in close combat, They were employed as soldiers by many Iranian empires, leading to many victories against the Romans, Arabs, and Turks. Their ferocity and skill in combat was said to be so great, even the Vikings feared them."
 ZKD_second: "Median Roots"
 ZKD_second_desc: "The Zikids origin comes from an Iranian officer 'Zik' hailing from Media in the 4th century AD. He would be instrumental in the conquest of Armenia and beyond during the reign of Shapur II. We have not forgotten our origins, and we shall seek to reconquer the territories that we have lost."
 ZKD_third: "Staunch Zoroastrians"
 ZKD_third_desc: "Gilan is isolated from the rest of Iran with its dense mountains and forests, here we follow the true and ancient ways of Ahura Mazda. Come Mongol or Turk we have yet flinch in our traditional ways and ceremonies, we are the true keepers of the flame."
 ZKD_fourth: "Gilani Defiance"
 ZKD_fourth_desc: "Many empires have tried to control Gilan, but none have succeeded. In our mountains we have always survived, and we will continue to do so until the Saoshyans cleanse this world of evil."

 ZKD_sixth: "Fahlaviyat"
 ZKD_sixth_desc: "Fahlaviyat was a designation for poetry composed in the local northwestern Iran. Fahlaviyat, which descended from Median dialects, substantially impacted by the Persian language, and had linguistic similarities with the Parthian language. Many great ideas and concepts have been created using this ancient art form."
 ZKD_seventh: "Restore Old Fortresses"
 ZKD_seventh_desc: "Dark clouds gather over Iran, and many wars will soon follow. It is of the utmost importance that we restore our old fortresses and castles in order to continue the proud tradition of Gilani exceptionalism."

 ISP_first: "Kin of the Sasanians"
 ISP_first_desc: "Throughout the Sassanid period, the House Ispahbad was acknowledged as the 'kin and partners of the Sasanians'. Although Sassanid dominance is but a fleeting memory, this ancient title helps portray us as a loyal and long lasting ally to the other houses of Iran."
 ISP_second: "Governors of Tabaristan"
 ISP_second_desc: "Through our own ability, and the calamities of previous centuries, we have come to make our home in the old province of Tabaristan. This is one of the richest lands in Iran, with its lush and fertile plains combined with a lucrative dominance in the Capsian and Persian trade networks. We should seek to continue to invest back into this region, to allow even greater exploitation."
 ISP_third: "Alborz Mountains"
 ISP_third_desc: "The Alborz mountains to our south provide an extremely useful strategic buffer between us and the rest of Iran. Tabaristan has long been saved from the destruction and conquest of the rest of Persia due to these barriers. It is only right that we seek to fortify the mountain passes in order to become even more unassailable"
 ISP_fourth: "Spahbed Legacy"
 ISP_fourth_desc: "Since the days of old, the Ispahbads have been known throughout Persia as formidable Spahbeds (generals). By calling on the legacies of our forefathers such as: Farrukh Hormizd, Farrukhzad, Rostam Farrokhzad, Vistahm, and Isfandyadh we still prove ourselves as successful and powerful leaders."
 ISP_fifth: "Haven for Exiles"
 ISP_fifth_desc: "Given Tabaristan's isolation from the rest of the region, many exiles fleeing other courts often come to our doorstep. Many of these men are competent officials and specialists in their own right. We should seek to encourage this migration and employ them in our own court."
 ISP_sixth: "Consolidate Tabaristan"
 ISP_sixth_desc: "Although Tabaristan is a rich and safe little province, the mountains and forest around us are home to many hostile tribes and rival houses. We should seek to not only integrate our own lands better into our empire, but also unite the rest of the Caspian coast under our house."
 ISP_seventh: "Great Coronations"
 ISP_seventh_desc: "Our geographical isolation is not only a boon for us geopolitically, but also culturally. We preserve many traditions of our Persian and Parthian past, including their grand coronations. These coronation festivities would last seven days, according to the old Iranian fashion, and included the usual feastings, rejoicings, giving of presents, while the notables and Ispahbads assembled from all the countryside. When these congratulations were finished, on the eighth day the Ispahad ascended the throne, girded on the royal girdle, and confirmed the governors in their appointments, and caused the Ispahbads and amirs to cast aside their mourning, and clad them in robes of honour."

 KRN_first: "Nahavand Castle"
 KRN_first_desc: "Since the times of Ardashir and Shapur, our mountain abode has been dominated by the foreboding Nahavand Castle. The castle has played a key part in the defence of western Iran, from Arabs, Turks, and Mongols alike. As long as house Karen holds the Castle, we will be independent."
 KRN_second: "House of Karen"
 KRN_second_desc: "The house of Karen is one of the oldest and most reputable houses in Iran. Going all the way back to Karen, the son of Kaveh the Blacksmith. We played a major role during the Parthian empire, and managed to successfully switch sides during the Sassanian rebellion, we would then go on to dominate many notable positions under their empire. Since then we have survived Arabs, Mihrans, Seljuks, Varazids, and Mongols, we would do well to remember this legacy."
 KRN_third: "Between Two Faiths"
 KRN_third_desc: "Our land is positioned on the edge of two major faiths, Islam to our West and South, and Zoroastrianism to our North and East. In order to survive we must always portray our dynasty in the best light, regardless of one's faith or affiliations."
 KRN_fourth: "Legacy of Sukhra"
 KRN_fourth_desc: "Sukhra of Karen was the most powerful minister under Shahanshah Peroz, and de facto head of the Sassanid empire after Peroz's untimely death. Following the Shah's death battling Hephthalites in the far east, Sukhra would lead a major avenging force, and crush the Hephthalites. Upon returning he would install two separate Shahs all while running the empire from the shadows. Despite eventually being exiled by Shah Kavad, Sukhra would still play a major role in Sassanian politics until his capture and execution. Despite his fall from grace, Sukhra's heirs would still dominate the administration of the Sassanids right up to their demise. He is our most illustrious ancestor and a model for our people to look up to."
 KRN_fifth: "Parthian Tolerance"
 KRN_fifth_desc: "Unlike the more hardline Zoroastrians of the east, we Karens have long preserved the traditions of tolerance, practised by our Parthian ancestors. Why worry about what the peasants worship, as long they pay taxes and pledge loyalty to us?"
 KRN_sixth: "Protect Zagros Routes"
 KRN_sixth_desc: "We control key access points through the Zagros mountains, connecting Persia with the Levant and beyond. We should look to exercise more complete control of these routes in order to more effectively tax the lucrative traders travelling through."
 KRN_seventh: "Rein in the Tribes"
 KRN_seventh_desc: "While being based in the mountains has many benefits, unity is not one of them. The foreboding Zagros mountains are home to many tribes of Kurds, Turks, Mongols, Lurs, and Persians all of whom barely pay us even lip service. We must begin to force our control more officially on these mountain tribes, to create a more unified state."

 INJ_third: "Found Shiraz"
 INJ_third_desc: "We should look to found a new Islamic capital for our empire. Built on top of the former capital of Fars, Istakhr, we will begin building. Soon the new city of Shiraz will not only be the centre of our powerbase, but also a beacon of prosperity, trade, piety, culture, and science in the Islamic world.  "
 INJ_fourth: "Arab Guard"
 INJ_fourth_desc: "The newly conquered Persians may not be the most loyal to our regime, and it may be best to bring in groups outside of Persia to maintain a loyal military. The Arabs to our South and West have held to the Prophet's teachings since the start of Islam, and using them to form a new 'Arab Guard' would provide us with a strong, cable, and most importantly loyal force to aid us in our conquest of Persia."
 INJ_fifth: "Patronise Islamic Learning"
 INJ_fifth_desc: "Long have many cities around us in Persia and the Levant been massive centres of learning and culture, if we are to be taken seriously in the Islamic world, Shiraz should be one as well. Let us patronise all forms of scholarship and learning, so as to improve both our understanding of the world around us, and our prestige amongst our neighbours."

 INJ_seventh: "Turkish Bombards"

 mrv_first: "Bane of the Khan"
 mrv_first_desc: "When the great Mongol hordes swept across the steppe and subdued the old Persian rulers, they had thought Marv would be like an Easter Lamb, fat and ready for slaughter. However, even while our city was still ruled by heathen governors, the Christian quarter of the city prayed nonstop after hearing of the Mongols nearing the city’s gates, fasting for days on end and only taking a break to sleep. All the while, the barbarian hordes tried to break through the city’s walls in vain - eventually, the Mongols offered our city autonomy in exchange for subjugation. Even so, very few cities in this region can boast of holding their own against the Mongol armies, yet we persevered thanks to Almighty God!"
 mrv_second: "Incentivize Silk Road Trade"
 mrv_second_desc: "As of late, the ancient routes of the Silk road have been drying up due to competition with merchants out at sea. No more! For as long as we control a key stopping point along the Silk Road, we shall work to maintain our grip over trade in the East by refurbishing our rest stops for traders as well as patronizing the most influential merchant families, allowing them to continue to compete with overseas trade."
 mrv_third: "Renovate the Walls of Merv"
 mrv_third_desc: "While we may have had the Lord’s blessing since we thwarted the Mongols centuries ago, many in this region covet our city for its wealth and central location in the Silk Road. We must build walls that reach up to the heavens themselves, and designed with modern weaponry and tactics in mind. Many will try, but all will fail to capture our great city!"
 mrv_fourth: "Venerate the Martyrs of Persia"
 mrv_fourth_desc: "Christianity has had a presence in Iran for countless centuries, however it has always been ruthlessly stamped out wherever it has cropped up by the Zoroastrian clergy, threatened by the truth of the Lord’s word. Countless have been martyred in God’s name in centuries past, and while many have been forgotten to history, our court’s scholars have been busy meticulously recording the names of those who were still remembered. Thanks to these new monastic texts, future generations will know now and forever of the names of these martyrs, and be inspired to spread the stories of their sacrifice to the unsaved!"
 mrv_fifth: "Preserve the Sogdian Language"
 mrv_fifth_desc: "The Sogdian language is in many ways a reflection of history of the region itself, an Iranian language written in monastic Aramaic and more recently even incorporating many Turkic loanwords. However, there is a real danger that our language may give way to the Turkic languages of the steppe or even the “Court Persian” of our western counterparts. We must work to patronize scholars who will officially codify our language so that it may be easily taught and spread across the region, ensuring its survival for centuries to come."
 mrv_sixth: "Restore St. Timur’s Tomb"
 mrv_sixth_desc: "St. Timur, a Mongol savage turned saint has been an inspiration for Christians across all of Iran and led to a new blossoming of the faith in Sogdia as thousands were inspired by his selflessness and pacifism. He is now buried in Samarkand, and the local Christian community built him a grand monastery where he and his writings are still preserved today. Now that the city is under our patronage, we should renovate the building in honor of this godly and pious man."
 mrv_seventh: "Catholicos Patriarch of All Eranshahr"
 mrv_seventh_desc: "Due to the occupation of Ctesiphon for hundreds of years, our church has been burdened with having to solve conflicts between the clergy without an impartial leader. No more! From this day forward, we do not bow to the whim of a far-flung Patriarch in Ctesiphon, controlled by our religious enemies. Instead, our Shah shall appoint a new patriarch who will rule from right here in Marv and claim dominion over all the Christians in the Greater Iran region."

 ssn_second: "Reunite the Empire"
 ssn_second_desc: "Our right to the lands of Persia and the Levant is undeniable to all, even the staunchest of our enemies; as such there is not much in the way of our expansion, and our future subjects know this all too well."

 ssn_third_desc: "The heathens are only heathens due to their flawed misconceptions about our reality. For our theologians, showing them the way is only a matter of time and effective rhetoric."
 ssn_fourth: "Maintain the Defensive Lines"
 ssn_fourth_desc: "Keeping one's gates closed and impregnable is, by default, the best way to win wars. While our armies ravage the enemy's territory, our garrisons must be prepared to hold the line to the last man, knowing that help is always a close call away."
 ssn_fifth: "The Office of Spahbed"

 srn_first: "The House of Suren"
 srn_first_desc: "The house of Suren is one of the oldest and most influential houses in all of Iran. Tracing our legacy back to the conquest of Parthia by Arsaces, our ancestors have defeated the Romans, invaded India, and crowned the Parthian Kings. We have proven to be adaptable and prospered under Sassanid, Mihranid, and Varazid hegemony. The time has come to take our true place among the other Persians, as the most ancient and respected great house of all time."
 srn_second: "Modernize Parthian Tactics"
 srn_second_desc: "Our use of Parthian Shot has won us many great victories in the past, most notably against the Romans. Times are changing however, and we should modernise our armed forces. By integrating shock cavalry along with the traditional horse archers in our army, we can continue to dominate the battlefields of Iran."
 srn_third: "Ariana, the Nexus of the Silk Road"
 srn_third_desc: "Since time immemorial, the Silk Road has flowed through Ariania and Sakastan. The Wealth of the East comes through our cities and continues out to the western lands or Europe and the Levant. We should seek to tax this trade more, in order to fund our ever expanding state."
 srn_fourth: "Betrayal of Suren"
 srn_fourth_desc: "Rustaham Suren was a great and powerful Parthian general, described by Plutarch as: 'an extremely distinguished man. In wealth, birth, and in the honour paid to him, he ranked next after the king; in courage and ability he was the foremost Parthian of his time; and in stature and personal beauty he had no equal'. Suren would be responsible for crushing the Romans at the battle of Carrhae. Despite his massive success, the general would be executed by the Parthian King for being a threat to the Arsacid powerbase. We have not forgotten this crime, and we should seek to prevent a situation such as this from happening again."
 srn_fifth: "Restore Bost"
 srn_fifth_desc: "The city of Bost, situated on the Helmand river with its strategic place on the Silk Road, is a good place to establish a new capital. Let us fortify and expand on the existing city, building many sprawling royal palaces and fire temples. Through our efforts, Bost can become the jewel of the east."
 srn_sixth: "Re-establish the Eastern Satrapies"
 srn_sixth_desc: "While not as well documented or populated as the more western satraps of Persis or Asoristan, the Eastern satrapies such as Sakastan, or Bactria are still rich in trade, goods, and warriors. By establishing our influence into these areas, we can recreate these old administrative boundaries and structures, and increase the administrative efficiency of our realm."
 srn_seventh: "Neo-Parthian Empire"
 srn_seventh_desc: "While the legacies of the Sassanids, Mihranids, and Varazids are remembered much more in most of Iran, we Surenas still cling to legacies of the Parthians. In antiquity, the Parthians would rule a sprawling empire from the Indus to Syria that humbled both Seleucids and Caesars. Given the Surenas long standing connection with the Arsacids, it is only just that we seek to re-create this hegemony."

His ambition to reunify Iran under one house proves to be a great source of inspiration for our soldiers to this day."
 shp_second: "New Iranian Power"
 shp_second_desc: "Since time immemorial Persia has been ruled by the old and decadent great houses. This all changed when Shapur launched his campaigns against them in the mid 15th century. Through stunning victories, our newly established house would go on to lay claim to all of Persia, and seek to restore the Ancient prestige of Kayanians."
 shp_third: "Secure the Gulf Trade"

 shp_fourth: "Splendor of Shapurshahr"
 shp_fourth_desc: "Seeking to be seen as a powerful and strong house in its own right. Shapur the Great established a new magnificent capital for his dynasty. Home to many palaces, fortresses, and universities, Shapurshahr would take its rightful place amongst the great cities of Iran."
 shp_fifth: "Architectural Renovation"
 shp_fifth_desc: "In the preceding centuries of foreign domination, Persian architecture had stagnated to some degree in terms of its grandness and size, Shapur would seek to end this. Calling on many great architects and mathematicians from all over the middle east, great innovations would be made in terms of building efficiencies and costs, leading to a revival of building programs throughout Persia."
 shp_sixth: "Indian Mercenaries"
 shp_sixth_desc: "One of the major things that led to Shapur the Great's stunning success would be his use of Indian soldiers in his armies. Although many Persians view India only a subordinate to the great Persian empires, Shapur sought to cultivate a strong relationship with many of the formidable Rajput and Punjabi states of western india. Using these new mercenaries to great effect, Shapur would go on to best many of the once great houses of Iran."

 mrh_third: "Bloodline of Shahrbaraz"
 mrh_third_desc: "Shahrbaraz or the 'Boar of the Empire' is one of our dynasties most legendary members. A hugely successful general who annihilated the Romans in many battles, the conqueror of Syria and Egypt, he would even make it to the gates of Constantinople itself. However, after being betrayed by his king and forced to give up his conquests, Shahrbaraz would go on to depose the wicked Khosrow II and capture Ctesiphon, becoming the first Shah of the Mihranids. While his success after this was short, eventually being replaced by Sassanids once again, Shahrbaraz's heroism and prowess inspire many Iranians to this day."

 pmn_first: "Populists in Government"
 pmn_first_desc: "While the Shahanshah and his dynasty were allowed to keep ultimate supreme authority over the state, our rebellion in the 16th century allowed us to enact a number of reforms and completely immerse our Elect into the seats of government. This makes our government more than most contemporary rulers, much more in sync with the needs and desires of its subjects, and as a result our policies are generally more accepted by the lower classes."
 pmn_second: "Mani, the Final Prophet"
 pmn_second_desc: "Despite the deluded musings of the Muslims who surround our nation, it is in fact the Prophet Mani, not Muhammad, who is the Final Prophet who brought the complete truth of the Divine to man’s attention, taking the truth found in every wise teacher of his time and streamlining it into a comprehensive series of holy books. Because Mani acknowledged the truth found in all our non-believing subjects' faiths, non-believers take far less issue with us then they would most other religions ruling over them."
 pmn_third: "Immortal Hearers"
 pmn_third_desc: "In our faith, there are two classes of believers, the 'elect' and the 'hearers'. The Hearers have not taken up all the solemn vows of Mani’s teaching, and instead serve the Elect who helps cleanse their sins and interface with the Divine for them. Our faith might be pacifistic by nature, but by advertising military service as a solemn duty to be taken up by the Hearers, we can insure the quality of professional troops who defend our state from heathen incursions.\nImmortals Discipline: §G+5.0%§!"

 pmn_sixth_desc: "Now that we once more rule over the great region of Iran, it is only past due that our head of faith, the Yamag, be restored to his rightful seat of power in Samarkand. However, since it is our state who has restored his position, it has allowed us to bring the Manichean church decisively within our state’s influence, and as a result our government benefits from a kind of caesaropapism."
 pmn_seventh: "Council of the Elect"
 pmn_seventh_desc: "As part of our demands to the Shahanshah, the instigators of the Manichean uprising proposed a legislative, advisory body be put in place to keep the nation in line with the will of the Divine. The ruling dynasty was resistant at first, however now enough pressure has mounted that we have convinced the Shahanshah of the wisdom of this decision. While obstructive on occasion, this body allows the commoners to feel more heard in government, as well as maintain our legitimacy with the people due to our court being directly guided by the most pious of the nation."

 ab_persia.1.d: "A silence has gripped Persia. The shrewd, awry discontent gripping the region, evidenced by the cold frigidity of mountains once proud and dead marketplaces once alive has come undone - all in a single night, it seems. Yet this was no sudden aberrance - alliances have been carefully constructed, boundaries have been systematically shattered and entire armies obliterated, rendering peaceful valleys awash with slain enemies. All these motions, all this carnage, all that which grips Persia in recency, has come for a reason. The [Root.GetName] have announced their right to Persia - and it is undeniable."

 ab_persia.4.d: "On a foggy morning amidst the ashy hills of Maragheh, a band of wagon-bound travellers were captured, hailed to a halt by a detachment of our men. Humble and downtrodden as these folk seemed, they were more than just travellers - they were the last of the Ilkhan, cleverly disguised, attempting to escape our forces. The Ilkhan's dozen or so wives spilled out of their wagons as the group was apprehended - a waterfall of gowns and perfume, lavish and excessive, tumbling to the dirt. Among them, the last Ilkhan came, disgraced and drunk. Taken to Tabriz, the oaf, beaten and bloodied beyond repair, was thrown to the gruelling dirt beyond the city walls. Alongside his brothers, concubines, wives and potential heirs, his inherent illegitimacy, cowardice and failure were declared for the whole world to hear, mouthed by the lips of our Shah himself. His head, as well as those of his disgraced retinue, were impaled atop the walls of Tabriz, allowed to waste until nothing but bone remained."

 ab_persia.5.t: "Resurgent Eranshahr" #reward of  'Iran-e Bozorg' mission
 ab_persia.5.d: "Land of the Aryans, Eranshahr - ruled by Persians once more. The world trembles in shock as a new great power emerges from Persia. For centuries, foreign conquerors, brutish fiends and bloody squabbles have dominated the region - its native population oppressed, downtrodden and reduced to squalor. No more, however - a Persian power has risen to prominence. Persian tongue, Persian religion, Persian ways - they proliferate and blossom, spreading like wildfire throughout a land tattered and bruised, the ways of old raging back into prominence after centuries of decay. Well beyond the Euphrates, well beyond the Indus, well beyond the Silk Road, those wise and those informed eye the situation with concern and trepidation - for Persia, a Persia true and a Persia old, has returned from the dead."

 ab_persia.6.t: "The Sack of Constantinople" #reward of  'Avenge Nineveh' mission
 ab_persia.6.d: "The gates of Constantinople spill ajar - as does blood spill into Hellenic soil. The screams of a thousand civilian bystanders pierce the thickening air as the city burns. Smoke billows upwards - blackened, gaseous hate staining a twilight sky at the behest of several dozen infernos, started intentionally. Great blasts and heavenly shudders echo across the city as irreparable, eternal damage rains down upon its inhabitants and structures alike. The Hagia Sophia crumbles in on itself - the building appearing mortified, sorrowful, pillars embracing one another as the ancient structure finally gives in. The foolish scripts within were dashed to the stone, set alight, much to the wailing horror of its diligent establishment. Tales and aftershocks of the unspeakable horror and cruelty echo across Europe - but the sacking was most impactful upon the Hellenic world, or what remained of it at least. At last, the Greeks themselves must admit - their time in the sun has ended, forever."

 ab_persia.7.t: "The Destruction of Jerusalem" #reward of  'Destroy Jerusalem' mission
 ab_persia.7.d: "It was not righteous fury. It was not calculated destruction. It was, rather, zealous vengeance. For days on end, soldiers pillaged the city. Marketplaces, local treasuries and temples were the first victims. On the second day, blood and coin alike stained every street in the market district, so copious that it was like walking on a rocky beach. Then, on the third day, the true destruction began. The Wailing Wall was presented to a cannon that had been brought into the city. Present Muslims, Christians and Jews alike were assembled to lay witness - and once assembled, they were asked to pray to their foolish god for the wall's salvation. Nothing came - and after the barrage, some say pieces of the brickwork could be found as far away as Gaza. Every cross in the city, great and small, has been burned. Every mosque has been turned to ash. Jerusalem, the holy heart of the Abrahamic faiths, has played its last beat - bringing a chill to the Christian, Muslim and Judaic worlds alike."

 ab_persia.8.d: "The Arabian coastline has been assimilated into our empire and with it, Mecca, home to the fabled 'Kaaba'. A unique distaste of this place lays in our hearts, owing to the Rashidun invasions, so we have chosen to pay our respects in the most fitting of ways. One sorry morning, Mecca was suddenly overcome by our armies. Under harsh orders, not a pot within the city was shattered - soldiers instead imposed martial law as the Shah and his personal guard marched to the Kaaba. Upon entering the sacred courtyard home to the black heart of Islam, those sacred and practiced adherents present were assembled and forced to kneel. There, on the ground, they beheld our Shah declaring the impotence of their faith - followed by the desecration, burning and obliteration of the Kaaba. Once every last brick had fallen, the Shah's decree of abstinence was wavered, martial law falling to the wayside. Mecca was sacked, brutally and beyond repair, over the course of a week. The holy men who bore witness to the Kaaba's destruction were allowed to live and walk free - as to spread word of Allah's failure."

No longer is that the case - fertile river valleys, bustling cities and booming trade networks flourish under our reign. While the Hindu tongues and ways more or less still proliferate their streets, their towns and their way of life, the inhabitants of India welcome our tolerant rule and work tirelessly to maintain it. After all, beneath our benevolent empire, they know no war, no squabbles, no foreign oppression.

 ab_persia.22.t: "The Reign of Tishtar the Wise"
 ab_persia.22.d: "Even as a small child, Tishtar’s father Yazdgerd saw that she had been set apart from her siblings by Ahura Mazda. A bright and inquisitive girl, it soon became apparent to Yazdgerd that her natural talents would be wasted as a bargaining chip in Ilkhanid politics, and sent her to the grand city of Marv to be given an education worthy of a queen. While away in Marv, she astonished her tutor in her knack for classical Iranian architecture, drawing up several detailed sketches all her own based off of old Achaemenid models. Her abilities were not limited to just a single field though. Through the careful nurturing of her tutor, she was able to become adept in the fields of rhetoric, philosophy, and statecraft. It is said as she was preparing to leave for Nishapur once more, that her tutor remarked: “Her tongue is as sharp as that of Aristotle, and her vision as grand as Isidore of Miletus.\n\nHer return to Nishapur, however, was not so warmly regarded. In her absence, her eldest brother Peroz had taken over after her father had passed away. Threatened by her natural charm and talent, Peroz had her confined to house arrest in all but name within her chambers not long after she returned. Unfortunately for House Mihran however, Peroz was more preoccupied with his many palace maids than stabilizing the realm after the Ilkhanid collapse. As Peroz’s many deficiencies began to reveal themselves to the court, Tishtar was able to persuade them to her cause, and gradually able to build up an underground support network amongst the nobility in Nishapur.\n\nThe final straw came when Peroz sought to offer Tishtar in marriage to the upstart lowborn Shapur. Not only did this incense Tishtar, but most of the nobility also. To marry off a Mihranid princess to a glorified merchant was unacceptable to them, and Tishtar finally had the support she needed to launch her plan into action. While on a hunting trip with his son outside Sabzevar, Peroz fell victim to an unfortunate accident when one of his retainers misfir e d and struck the king and his young heir instead of the tiger they had been pursuing. The new queen, in an act of supreme clemency, pardoned the retainer after assessing he had not premeditated the killing of her elder brother. From there on, Tishtar would prove herself to be a wise and capable ruler, patronizing many former Ilkhanid courtiers who had lost their jobs after its untimely demise, and even contributing her own writings to the library at Nishapur. As she approaches 40 years of age with many years of wise governorship behind her, it is clear Tishtar “the Wise” will go down as one of Persia’s most capable rulers."
 ab_persia.22.a: "Hail Tishtar, Jewel of Nishapur and Queen of Queens!"
 ab_persia.23.t: "The Reign of Shapur the Great"
 ab_persia.23.d: "At the beginning of the Ilkhanate’s downfall, not many would have placed their bets on a humble merchant from Hormirzad rising to become pre-eminent inheritor of the Varazid legacy. Yet, Shapur was an exceptional man even before he became known as “the Great”. As a young man, Shapur fought as a local mercenary for the Ilkhanate, putting down rebellions and fighting against other successors of Temujin on the Ilkhanate’s behalf, distinguishing himself as a clever and brave soldier, and eventually, officer. Shapur eventually retired from mercenary work altogether, pooling his funds into an overseas enterprise contracting Indian spice merchants and selling their wares in his home city. Employing the services of the fearsome Rajputs as caravan guards for his cargo.\n\nAs the Ilkhanate began to buckle under its own weight, however, fate would have Shapur enter battle once more - this time, against the Ilkhanid governor of Mogostan. Like with most of the other Persian and Mongol nobility, he ouste d the Borjigins and began fighting with other warlords for the throne of Eranshahr. However, to fund his wars he had placed crippling taxes on Shapur and his fellow merchants, and the wily Shapur saw his chance to bounce. He formed a coalition of dissatisfied merchants and local commanders, and demanded the governor reverse his policies. He refused, and so Shapur’s army surrounded the palace at Hormirzad. The governor, confident in his strength of numbers, sallied out and met Shapur in open battle. However, through careful maneuvering and personal command of his Rajput mercenaries, Shapur was able, against all odds, to overcome the governor, who committed suicide not long after he saw his defeat. The notable merchants in the city then surrendered the city to Shapur, who proceeded to reverse all the unpopular tax policies in Hormirzad.\n\nDespite his low birth, his shrewd and lenient policies with the lower and middle classes legitimized him in the eyes of most, with the merchants of Hormirzad even calling a v ote to rechristen the city “Shapurshahr” in his honor. Shapur’s ambitions would not stop there, however, and he would go on to depose other weak Ilkhanid successors in Sistan and Khorasan, as well as fighting a lightning campaign against the Sassanids for control of Isfahan. Now, as the Great Shapur grows to a ripe old age, it is clear his legacy will secure his future heirs a legitimacy just as prestigious as Iranian Great Houses of old."

As we were searching through her belongings to distribute them according to her will, we discovered completed schematics of a new fortress-city just outside Nishapur proper. Heavily inspired by ancient Achaemenid architectural motifs and named after its eponymous designer, it would be connected to Nishapur proper by a thick stone wall, which would be linked with Nishapur’s already existing fortifications. As for the interior of the city, it would of course be host to a grand palace, as well as a new royal academy, and an expansive residential area within the city walls for the most important scholars, architects, and artisans. Lastly, the palace itself would be host to an imposing citadel that looked out over the whole of the city, where the garrison could hide out in case the exterior walls were somehow breached and give the army additional time to intercept enemy fo rces. If we were to commission the royal architects to bring these schematics to life, they would no doubt bring unprecedented grandeur to our realm - however, the cost and planning needed for such an undertaking gives our treasurer pause about setting the project into motion."
 ab_persia.24.a: "Found the city!"
 ab_persia.24.b: "Sell the schematics to a collector."
 ab_persia.25.t: "Manichaean Resurgence"
 ab_persia.25.d: "Light always casts shadow, and some more than most. With the dawning of a shining new age of spiritual belief for our nation, darker shadows than usual have emerged. The winds of heresy blow cold and in their wake Gnostic plots emerge. A resurgence of belief in the apostasy of Mani is spreading across the land in the wake of a new dissemination of the Shaburaghan, encouraging blasphemous following of this so-called ‘Religion of Light’. The preacher behind this work, one ‘Hermas’ claims to have received divine revelation from the Father of Greatness, and ordered to continue proselytising Mani’s teachings and return as many souls as possible to the World of Light. This rabble-rouser is gathering a strong following amongst our subjects, and unless we act swiftly this may be the start of an uprising "
 ab_persia.25.a: "These apostates will be crushed."

 ab_persia.26.t: "The Imperial Pelt"
 ab_persia.26.d: "Against the unrelenting might of the Persian juggernaut, it finally dawned upon the Byzantines that their situation was hopeless. A reluctant party of negotiators was eventually sent to plead with the Shah for peace and mercy, with the Basileus at its head. Exasperated to the ends of his wit, the Basileus had complained throughout the diplomatic mission that the Persians would hide him and have his guts for garters. Of course, nobody expected such fears would come to fruition in the most literal sense. After dismissing the other diplomats, the Basileus was forced to prostrate before the Shah and his entourage, although his readiness to sell out Byzantium in exchange for his own life is ironically what sealed his fate. After the deed was done, the Basileus' flayed remains were catapulted over the walls of Constantinople and into the city's Palace District, while the Imperial Pelt found itself hoisted atop the Shah's tent as if it were his own standard. The Basileus' gilded skull, fashioned i nto an ornate drinking cup, was subsequently gifted to the Sofia branch of Osman & Sons, where it now sits upon the Chief Executive Vizier's desk. With the spoils of war now divided fairly, the current conflict shall soon come to an end."
 ab_persia.26.a: "I may have gone too far in a few places..."
 PER_SKIN_BYZANTINE: "[BYZ.Monarch.GetName] will be §Rskinned§!."
 ab_persia.20.t: "Addressing the Divide"
 ab_persia.20.d: "Questions of Theology have plagued the Shah for ages now, while most of the Ummah is Sunni this includes the self-proclaimed Caliphate of Andalusia and the ever-powerful Nizzarids. Staying Sunni would likely improve our ties with the rest of the major Muslim powers, they seem content with bickering amongst themselves rather than spreading the word of Allah. Converting to Shia Islam would be as much a religious as a political decision and would likely cause turmoil in our realm but could help us set ourselves apart from the old Islamic hegemons. How shall we proceed my Shah?"
 ab_persia.20.a: "We could never abandon Abu Bakr and the rightful Caliphs!"
 ab_persia.20.b: "We shall spread the word of the Imams!"
 ab_persia.21.t: "The Conquest of Mecca"
 ab_persia.21.d: "The Arabian coastline has been assimilated into our empire and with it, Mecca, home to the fabled Kaaba. A holy temple that is at the heart of our faith and that any Muslim must visit in his lifetime in accordance with the Hajj. One beautiful morning our troops arrived, hailed as liberators and unifiers in the eyes of the once-divided Arab tribes. Upon entering the sacred courtyard home to the magnificent Kaaba, the Shah, and his retinue walked around the sacred site seven times and kissed the al-Hajar al-Aswad. The adherents present to witness this beheld our Shah declaring Islam's triumph over the followers of Ahura Mazda as Iran has finally joined the Ummah under his guidance."
 ab_persia.21.a: "May Ar-Rahman smile upon the Iranian people!"

# Missions #
 per_mongoltactic_title: "Adopt Mongol Tactics"
 per_mongoltactic_desc: "A wise man once recounted that we must learn from our enemies - especially those triumphant. The fearsome Mongol ways harken back to those of old, of the Parthians and the steppe warriors of before. We must concede and forget our pride just this once - learn where we went wrong so that we must not fall again. Saddle up!"
 per_army_title: "Gond-i Shah"
 per_army_desc: "The wretched Ilkhanate has fallen - their foul-breathed elites retreating into the Caucasus like the rats they are. They have left Persia in tatters, reduced to squabbling houses and raving mystics. We would be fools to ignore our surplus of manpower and fateful positioning - Persia is ours for not only the taking, but the rebuilding!"
 per_divided_title: "A House Divided"
 per_divided_desc: "We have emerged from turmoil and established ourselves as a figurehead. Our neighbours gaze upon us with newfound respect - and if not respect, fear. Having recovered from the brutality of the Mongols, risen to great heights in spite of it, our proud house is well on its way towards proving itself worthy of Persian hegemony. Let us reach for it!"
 per_princes_title: "Princes of Persia"
 per_princes_desc: "Persia has fallen into disunity. Centuries of abuse and conflict have reduced our peoples, varying and middling as they are, to pathetic rivalries. On all sides, we are surrounded by bickering fools - fools which stand in the way of a prosperous, united Persia. Let us exercise our diplomatic muscles and prove that we are the heirs of our mighty ancestors."
 per_cataphracts_title: "Modernise the Cataphracts"
 per_cataphracts_desc: "The Cataphracts - mounted warriors and hoofed beasts plated all over in the finest metal armour - were a staple of old Persia. Cataphracts struck fear in the hearts of our rivals of old, shattering Roman legions and rebel rabble alike with impunity. So successful were they that the remnant Romans of later ages adopted our tactics, seeking to copy us - admittedly, to great effect. Let us revive this monster of the battlefield!"
 per_elephants_title: "Reintroduce War Elephants"
 per_elephants_desc: "Our army's efficacy has reached new heights. Intelligence, boldness, power and determination - our armies are known for these traits, led now by generals with decades of experience, fashioned into hordes of fearsome Cataphracts and brutal infantry. With this restored might, it is only fitting that we restore yet another pillar of our fallen legacy - the dreaded war elephant. The bones of our enemies shall be pounded to dust beneath their might!"
 per_immortals_title: "Revive the Immortals"
 per_immortals_desc: "Our proud history has been muddied and diluted over time. Legends stand out however - paramount among them, that of the Immortals. Recalled by ancient Persian and Roman scholars alike, the Immortals were fierce heavy infantry of great standing, numbering 10,000 at any given time, no more, no less. In service, they guarded not only our ruler, but the empire as a whole. With our military might and burgeoning empire, it seems right that we revive this legend and make our enemies cower!"
 per_iran_title: "Iran-e Bozorg"
 per_iran_desc: "We are ascendant. Our neighbours have crumbled - either falling into our sphere of influence or falling into the raging waters of history, fading just like a thousand other silly warlords. With our strength insurmountable and our horizons broadening by the day, the total reclamation of Persia is within sight. Onward!"
 per_ilkhanate_title: "Execute the Ilkhan"
 per_ilkhanate_desc: "Fallen and dilapidated as they are, the steppe fiends persist in their malice, exercising cruelty over the valleys of the Caucasus. They seek to bide their time - waiting for a new moment to raze, plunder and oppress. This cannot come to pass. Every last Mongol warlord must be brought to heel - so that Mongol rule, in the mind of every peasant, far and near, may become but a distant memory."
 per_secure_gulf_title: "Secure the Coastline"
 per_secure_gulf_desc: "The Persian Gulf is a den of trade. Merchants from far and wide traverse its rocky coastlines to ferry the whimsical riches of India to the proud zealots of the Levant. As a result, it has rich maritime foundations, as well as well-worn, critical defensive positions and valuable ports. Securing the southern coastline will grant us naval supremacy over our regional rivals."
 per_recover_meshan_title: "Recover Meshan"
 per_recover_meshan_desc: "Shy of our most recent coastal acquisitions is Meshan - the gates to old Mesopotamia and the twin rivers of the Tigris and the Euphrates. Establishing a foothold will establish for us a monopoly - a mercantile handhold which we can grip, squeeze, clench, wrangle every last coin and gem from. Meshan must return to our fold - so that our neighbours may know true hunger, true poverty, and beg for our overlordship."
 per_monopolize_title: "Monopolise the Gulf"
 per_monopolize_desc: "With the southern coastline in our grip, we may begin to compete with the wily Hormuzi and the bold Hindus. Should we strengthen our mercantile muscles, empower our regional merchants and secure trade within the region, we could easily dominate the Gulf's commerce and establish an unbreakable monopoly for centuries to come."
 per_gerrha_title: "Claim Gerrha"
 per_gerrha_desc: "To the south of Meshan is Gerrha - a vital Arabian coastline, rife with fierce commercial competition. For centuries, the Khaleeji of Arabia have competed valiantly with our native merchants - but no more, we say. With our resurgent strength, we may conquer and assimilate this region, making it a vital addition to our blossoming trade empire."
 per_mazun_title: "Conquer Mazun"
 per_mazun_desc: "A symbolic victory is in sight. Mazun, heartland of the Khaleeji, the Hormuzi merchants our empire tirelessly competes against, sits at our feet. Helpless and petty, they may fall to our efforts - and with the tip of Arabia in our grasp, a monopoly, a domination outright of the Indian Ocean, could be within our grasp, securing our place in the world as a naval hegemon to be feared."
 per_consolidate_title: "Consolidate the Realm"
 per_consolidate_desc: "Persia has fallen beneath our banner. Its totality sits within our grasp - every valley gouged into the ancient earth, every arid desert settlement sitting eternally on the outskirts of civilised life, they all fall under our influence - yet they do not kneel. Separatist sentiment, radicalised peasantry and rampant disorganisation must be quelled. Our subjects must learn their place!" 
 per_seat_title: "Seat of the Shahanshah"
 per_seat_desc: "Persia bows before us, yet our capital does not stand as high as it should. From the hot sands of Cairo to the distant silk-laden east, it is known that marvellous, empowering capitals spring up where rightful, legitimate kings reign. We must waste no more time - our Shahanshah deserves a proper capital!"
 per_tribes_title: "Subjugate the Tribes"
 per_tribes_desc: "To the north, chaos reigns. Since time immemorial, fiendish savages have reigned over the steppe. Once in a blue moon, wise and humble peoples come forth from the maws of history to provide us with splendid company, but this cannot be counted upon. The steppe is dangerous and so are its inhabitants. We'd best bring the fight to them and subjugate their energies, lest they bring the fight to us."
 per_silk_title: "Follow the Silk Road"
 per_silk_desc: "To the east, the intrepid Tocharians, foreigners yet Persians deep-down, have established a curious little culture on the boundless plains amidst the leering mountains of Kashgaria. Under watchful snow-capped peaks, Tocharian merchants strive to capitalise upon the ancient Silk Road - the route to the infamous, unseen realm of China in the far east. Perhaps absorbing the Tocharians could bring us new opportunities."
 per_dragon_title: "Confront the Dragon"
 per_dragon_desc: "With the Silk Road in our grasp, we have come before China - the eternal dragon of the far east, an empire, a civilisation, a world in its own right, so far-removed and insulated that it views all beyond its borders with heavenly scorn, demanding tribute and respect. We are no savages, however. We are no petty peasant tribe to be bullied and vassalized. We are Persians and they will learn this - either the easy way or the hard way."
 per_china_trade_title: "Trade with China"
 per_china_trade_desc: "Having established ourselves in this strange new world, new opportunities present themselves. The fine and spectacular goods of China, available in tantalising, awesome surplus, lay waiting to be capitalised on. Our merchants yearn to enrich themselves, our sailors eye the marshy coasts greedily and our nobles plot in earnest. Our time to strike is now - China's riches await!"
 per_turkmen_title: "Recruit the Turkmen"
 per_turkmen_desc: "The steppe's southern extent has been conquered and tamed. Yet our nobles postulate more could be done. If we were to assimilate more tribes to our hegemony, integrate lands of key importance, we could in theory establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower. The steppe peoples yearn eternally for war, for glory, for coin - what better way to tame them than to give them what they want?"
 per_georgia_title: "Devastate Georgia"
 per_georgia_desc: "Georgia has been a point of contention for our ancestors. Over the long centuries, Georgia, Armenia and the mountains of the Caucasus have been a place of struggle, where Roman, Persian and mercenary blood alike have been shed, drying in the old and wizened mountain valleys. Now, no vast, treacherous empire waits to challenge us - the region is ours for the picking, ours to dominate, ours to claim."
 per_seljuks_title: "Chasten the Seljuks"
 per_seljuks_desc: "The Seljuk Turks once shredded through Persia. Like the foul marauders they are, they wandered west, burning and desecrating all in sight until choosing to settle in the east of Anatolia. Their current rulers, their current peasantry, their current nobles, may have all forgotten their history, how their ancestors plundered us - but we have not. In due time, the Turks will be punished for their misdeeds - retribution will come."
 per_march_title: "March on Constantinople"
 per_march_desc: "Across the glimmering waters of the Bosporus sits a city eternal - the city of Constantinople, founded and pioneered by its namesake simply to situate the Roman power structure closer to our borders, to keep us at bay. Countless hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of our ancestors, bled in the once-endless struggle against Roman tyranny. To capture Constantinople, to subjugate Thrace, to advance upon the wretched coastlines of Greece, would be to restore our honour and avenge our ancestors." 
 per_avenge_title: "Avenge Nineveh"
 per_avenge_desc: "A thousand years have passed since a humiliation so brutal that it stains our history. The bastard Roman Heraclius shattered our armies at the ancient Assyrian site of Nineveh, sending the Sassanian realm into such catastrophic disarray that the Muslims dared attempt to brutalise our people and way of life in a struggle that lasted centuries. Now, we have returned - Nineveh and the Bosporus alike are ours. Constantinople, one of the beating hearts of Roman identity, awaits. Let us have our revenge."
 per_levantine_title: "Levantine Incursion"
 per_levantine_desc: "Before the Muslims, before the Christians, before Alexander, the Levant was a wing of our empire. Zoroaster's word stretched from Gaza to Ghor - simpler, better times, which were robbed from us by heathens, barbarians and treacherous ravagers. With the Levant tantalisingly close, our generals, our armies, yearn to reclaim what was once ours - and just one triumph could empower our military's morale to blazing heights unseen."
 per_jerusalem_title: "Capture Jerusalem"
 per_jerusalem_desc: "Muslims, Christians and Jews alike squabble over a city nestled beside the Dead Sea. With so many lives lost to a damnable wall, a bemusing hill and the coveted remains of a cross with so many fabled pieces that one could fashion a fleet from it, it'd probably be best if the city were ruled by us. Thousands of years of wars and conflicts over this city will finally ended..."
 per_agiptus_title: "Reclaim Agiptus"
 per_agiptus_desc: "Egypt was a jewel of our empire. It is an ancient granary, a heartland of North Africa, the western extent of old Persia. Robbed from us over a thousand years ago by the wily Alexander and his rabble of Macedonian curs, Egypt has since been torn apart - going from Greek, to Roman, to Arabic hands in the blink of an eye. We have no doubt that the Arabic Egyptians, unfamiliar as they are to the Persian ways, would gladly welcome our stability and tolerance."
 per_arabia_title: "Heart of Islam"
 per_arabia_desc: "Through the rugged mountains south of the Levant, one can find the Kaaba - the heart of the Muslim faith, the source of Dar al-Islam. Much like Jerusalem, the fabled beating heart of Islam could become under our command. The control of [385.GetName] marks our claim to the whole Arabia. All of the Muslim world will soon bow before us."
 per_persianize_title: "Persianize the Turks"
 per_persianize_desc: "Anatolia is ours and with it, a sizable population of Turks. Their tenacity and wealth of manpower cannot be denied - they would make a fine addition to the empire, should they be educated and civilised. If we were to rid them of the various accumulated traditions and tongues clinging to them, we could assimilate the Turks beneath our cultural banner - make them Iranians, well and true, for centuries to come."
 per_terminus_title: "Terminus of the Silk Road"
 per_terminus_desc: "Egypt is in our grasp and our empire greets the Mediterranean with open arms, welcoming its riches and eager merchants as if they were old friends. This has not come without issue, however - greedy Europeans have leapt at the chance to exploit the turmoil, slipping into a kind of economic power vacuum to garner as much wealth as possible. We must have none of it - Aleppo and Alexandria bow to US, it is OUR coin which reigns here! Only through Persia can the lifeblood of the Silk Road be ferried!"
 per_maragheh_title: "The Maragheh Observatory"
 per_maragheh_desc: "Centuries ago, an observatory was constructed by the Ilkhanids just shy of the city of Maragheh. To their credit, many notable astronomers and scientists flocked to the site, pioneering strange new inventions and astronomical observations. Sadly, lack of patronage and neglect have reduced the observatory to a depleted husk. To celebrate our reclamation and restoration of Persia, we should restore the observatory!"
 per_mesopotamia_title: "The Fertile Crescent"
 per_mesopotamia_desc: "To our west, crowding the Tigris and the Euphrates, sits a world abused, in tatters and bereft of autonomy - a world where civilisation once blossomed and stood tall. At our height, we cradled the Fertile Crescent, bestowed upon it the respect it deserved. Now, we must do so again - drive out the barbarians which dare despoil it!"
 per_ctesiphon_title: "Rebuild Ctesiphon"
 per_ctesiphon_desc: "For hundreds of years, Ctesiphon stood as a ceremonious capital of Persia. Known as a place where several cities crowded, met and eventually merged, Ctesiphon was a vital geopolitical crossroad and some say one of the largest cities in the world. After the Muslim conquest however, the city fell into disarray. With vengeance on the menu, our advisors suggest we make of its ruins a city far grander, far more magnificent, far more wealthy than any seen before - a new Ctesiphon, a shining Ctesiphon!"
 per_nahrawan_title: "Improve the Nahrawan"
 per_nahrawan_desc: "During the times of Parthia, great works were undertaken along the Tigris and Euphrates to ensure water flowed where it was needed. Mesopotamia was fed by its convoluted, sprawling system of veins - farmers and peasants alike depending on the flow of its waters for sustenance and prosperity. Barbaric infighting and countless wars have seen the canals abused and razed however. Now that we are back in charge, it is our divine duty to see these great works restored and Mesopotamia prosper."
 per_kushan_title: "Kushanshah"
 per_kushan_desc: "South of our Tocharian holdings, one gazes upon Kashmir - a beautiful boundary between the Hindu world and the heavenly peaks of the Himalayas. Countless riches, sprawling histories and ruins aplenty line the region's many forested valleys. By virtue of proximity, we deserve to reign over its totality." 
 per_indus_title: "Descend into Indus Valley"
 per_indus_desc: "The Indus Valley is a peculiar place - a crossroads where cultures clash, where empires have risen and fell and where ancients once forged the first empires. Today, it is a sprawling place, a ripe cornerstone of India, a gateway akin to Kashmir... and a gateway we will smash ajar and exploit. By conquering the Indus Valley, we may not only gain another vantage point, but also sever and drain an artery of Indian manpower and supplies."
 per_windia_title: "Control West India"
 per_windia_desc: "India bleeds. Its petty rulers, disunited and sprawling, cower in fear. If we were to utterly dominate the region's western extent, we could establish a trade monopoly that could not only starve out our remaining enemies, but announce to India and the world at large who the region's true master is."
 per_gangetic_title: "Claim Gangetic Plain"
 per_gangetic_desc: "Kashmir has been absorbed into our empire. As a result, the northern reach of India, known as the Gangetic Plain, sits before us. Over the long centuries, many a conqueror has descended upon the plain, exploiting its unfortunate geography so that he might lay claim to India's totality. We shall do the same - bringing India to heel."
 per_bengal_title: "Conquer Bengal"
 per_bengal_desc: "India's east is dominated by thick, riveting rainforests. Fearsome beasts, mortifying disease and horrors beyond imagination lurk the blackened jungles - yet the inhabitants have made for themselves a civilisation unique and bountiful, taming a vast, intricate ecosystem to sustain themselves. Let us cash in on it and exploit the region's tantalising trade!"
 per_hindustan_title: "Empire of Hindustan"
 per_hindustan_desc: "India sits at our feet - subjugated, kneeling, grateful. Its thousands of peoples speak in their many tongues of our grace, of the teachings of Zoroaster, of the prosperity brought by Persia's tolerance and acceptance. We will no doubt make short work of the rest of the region - and in no time at all, the world will know us as the true masters of India, as the empire that rules over Hindustan."
 per_spice_title: "Reach the Spice Islands"
 per_spice_desc: "Beyond China, beyond India, beyond the sparkling seas known by our ancestors, their neighbours, their rivals and their sailing merchants, lay treasures beyond comprehension. What kind of treasure? Spice. The spices of a thousand glimmering plants lay in wait, said to inflame the tongue, enrich the senses and make one's belly bubble with ravenous hunger. Merchants the world over covet these culinary marvels and if we were to dominate the source, we could dominate the world... or at least its kitchens."
 per_integrate_title: "Integrate the Hindus"
 per_integrate_desc: "The population of a golden subcontinent such as India shall be regarded not as just another one of our subject nations, but as adequate partners to our great civilization - unfortunately, only once we've they are fully subjugated that we can begin integrating them into our society as equals."
 per_architecture_title: "Indo-Iranian Architecture"
 per_architecture_desc: "It would truly be a pity not to bring our newly integrated lands to their fullest potential. When our enlightened regime is finished there, India will be sprawling with, however large, a sea of fully operative and efficient cities in our civilization's name."
 per_arab_outpost_title: "Arab Trade Outposts"
 per_arab_outpost_desc: "The Gulf that takes our name, we share with the undeserving children of Mohammad; may their shores fall to our mighty blows, for we can put it to better use ourselves."
 per_aden_title: "The Gate of Lamentation"
 per_aden_desc: "Across the vast sands lies Bab-el-Mandeb, or the Gate of Lamentation, our king among kings cannot afford to be deprived of such a prized possession. The weak-minded and greedy princes of Arabia Felix and Abyssinia shall certainly concede or be blown to bits at our navy's doing."
 per_african_bases_title: "East African Bases"
 per_african_bases_desc: "Taking a page out of our southern neighbourhood, many important statesmen insist it is now time to make the Indian Ocean a Persian Ocean; the perfect lands to begin this process are off the Swahili coast, viewed as succulent prey by our generals and merchants alike. To glory!"
 per_south_africa_title: "Claim the Cape"
 per_south_africa_desc: "On our recent endeavours to circumnavigate Africa, we believe to have encountered its southernmost point. While they may just be sandy reefs now, the explorers who witnessed them foresaw within them the potential to become an international trading hub; were we to take it over now, every empire in the world would have to pay a toll to us in order to pass through it."
 per_unknown_title: "Into the Unknown"
 per_unknown_desc: "The Ocean is vast and unpredictable; it was our duty to chart it, it is our chance to settle it and our hope is to control it entirely. As our settlers march into the less fortunate regions of Africa, we wonder not whether these savages know of our might, for we shall make sure they - all of them, from Ireland to Cathay - remember the glory of the Persian Empire."
 per_fortify_hormuz_title: "Fortify Hormuz"
 per_fortify_hormuz_desc: "The island of Hormuz, named after our ancestral deity Ahura Mazda, serves as the gateway from our gulf to the Ocean outside. Given how crucial it is to control it, it's just as pivotal that we have a way to defend it in times of great need."
 per_maintain_title: "Maintain the Defensive Lines"

 per_persian_renaissance_title: "Persian Renaissance"
 per_persian_renaissance_desc: "Across the world, the city-states of Italy have had the bright idea of returning to their ancient glory, when still their head Rome made a worthy rival.

 per_educate_masses_title: "Educate the Masses"

 per_reorganize_church_title: "Reorganise the Church"
 per_reorganize_church_desc: "The Manichaean church is, tragically, a smorgasbord of contradictions, superfluity and loopholes.

 per_church_east_title: "The Church of the East"
 per_church_east_desc: "Our faith has spent far to much time at the mercy of Persian, Mongol, or Turkish overlords and our organization as a faith has clearly suffered.

 per_address_divide_title: "Address the Divide"
 per_address_divide_desc: "Ever since the Shiites proclaimed Ali was the rightful heir to Muhammad, appointed by Allah himself, the Islamic world has been divided.

 per_islam_arc_title: "Islamic Architecture"

Cataphracts struck fear in the hearts of our rivals of old, shattering Roman legions and rebel rabble alike with impunity. So successful were they that the remnant Romans of later ages adopted our tactics, seeking to copy us - admittedly, to great effect. Let us revive this monster of the battlefield!"
 ilk_elephants_title: "Reintroduce War Elephants"
 ilk_elephants_desc: "Our army's efficacy has reached new heights. Intelligence, boldness, power and determination - our armies are known for these traits, led now by generals with decades of experience, fashioned into hordes of fearsome Cataphracts and brutal infantry. With this restored might, it is only fitting that we restore yet another pillar of our fallen legacy - the dreaded war elephant. The bones of our enemies shall be pounded to dust beneath their might!"
 ilk_immortals_title: "Revive the Immortals"
 ilk_immortals_desc: "Our proud history has been muddied and diluted over time. Legends stand out however - paramount among them, that of the Immortals. Recalled by ancient Persian and Roman scholars alike, the Immortals were fierce heavy infantry of great standing, numbering 10,000 at any given time, no more, no less. In service, they guarded not only our ruler, but the empire as a whole. With our military might and burgeoning empire, it seems right that we revive this legend and make our enemies cower!"

 ilk_sabzevar_desc: "The city of Sabzevar and her jewel, the fire temple of Atash Bahram, must both be restored to their ancient status as one among five beacons of our faith."
 ilk_mobeds_title: "Accommodate the [Root.GetChurchOrFallbackName]"
 ilk_mobeds_desc: "Many priests left Persia after the tragic end of the first Sasanid Empire. After all these years, their descendants are finally coming back to us, ready to preach the glory of Ahura Mazda to their long-lost people - and we must grant them an accomodation worthy of kings."
 ilk_diaspora_title: "Zoroastrian Diaspora"
 ilk_diaspora_desc: "Across India, the Parsees - descendants of our ancestors who escaped Muslim persecution in the middle ages - are now hearing of our powerful state and of the rekindling of the royal fires. We must strive to welcome them in the best way possible, like brothers long lost now reunited."
